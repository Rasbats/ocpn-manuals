= Compile on Slackware

== Building OpenCPN package in Slackware

Building a package in Slackware is a bit more intricate than the way
described above (see: http://www.slackwiki.com/Building_A_Package ). +
 +
A simplified way is to use *src2pkg*. +
You can build a Slackware package using src2pkg, that's what the sketch
below is about. +
-Please note that Slackware, unlike Debian-apt-get, Fedora-yum and
OpenSuSE-zypper, does not solve dependencies. +
You have to take care of that yourself and build and install the
packages in correct order. +
Concerning the Slackbuilds below, we present them in that order. +
 +
First, as for the other distributions, uninstall any previous
installation:

....
bash-4.2# removepkg opencpn
....

{empty}1. Dependencies:

Provided a *_full Slackware installation_*(the ordinary "Slackware way"
and presumed by the scripts from Slackbuilds.org):

Install src2pkg from
http://distro.ibiblio.org/amigolinux/download/src2pkg/ +
After installation it takes you through a guided setup, default values
are usually good enough.

Then build and install: +
Either: gpsd tinyxml wxPython portaudio from Slackbuilds.org* +
Or better: gpsd tinyxml libmspack portaudio wxGTK from Slackbuilds.org

If you choose wxGTK you must edit the Slackbuildscript for wxGTK and add
â€“enable-graphics_ctx +
under .configure according to the following:

....
./configure \

--prefix=/usr \

--libdir=/usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX} \

--sysconfdir=/etc \

--enable-shared \

--enable-graphics_ctx \ # **add this**.

--enable-mediactrl \

--with-opengl \

--${_do_unicode}able-unicode \

--build=$ARCH-slackware-linux
....

=== 2. Download and pack source code

Get the current beta sourcecode by

....
bash-4.2$ git clone git://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git
....

//or as the stable is released: //

....
bash-4.2$ git clone -b release32_stablehttps://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git
....

//You'll get the directory OpenCPN. Change the name of the directory to
lowercase letters and add it's version number (you can read it from
OpenCPN/VERSION.cmake) opencpn-3.2.2 (or version-number of your
download) +
pack it to a .tar.gz //

....
bash-4.2$ tar czf opencpn-3.2.2.tar.gz opencpn-3.2.2/
....

=== 3. Build package

Go superuser and use src2pkg

....
bash-4.2$ su
Password: *******

bash-4.2# src2pkg opencpn-3.2.2.tar.gz
....

the package goes to /tmp

=== 4. Install it:

....
bash-4.2# installpkg /tmp/opencpn-3.2.2-x86_64-1.txz (-i486 for x86 arch)
....

Built in this way it installs in /usr/ +
In XFCE it goes to Applications Menu "Education". +
 +
*Notes about the dependencies* +
*/wxPython -ca 20MB- is a heavy package and includes among other things
python-bindings that are not needed by OpenCPN. +
wxGTK -ca 4MB- is -according to Slackbuilds.org a part of wxPython and
conflict if both are installed. See wxGTK-README. +
WxGTK + libmspack are enough for OpenCPN provided the Slackbuildscript
is edited as suggested above.
