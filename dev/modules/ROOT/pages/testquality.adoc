== How to use TestQuality

Get an account on testquality. From your github account online go to
github marketplace or apps and search for Testquality
https://github.com/marketplace/testquality/plan/MDIyOk1hcmtldHBsYWNlTGlzdGluZ1BsYW44MTM=#pricing-and-setup[TestQuality
Setup]

In your own testquality account, you can create projects as you like.
Each project can be, for example, one of the plugins you are working on.
You would link your GitHub repository to the testquality project. This
is important.

First, you need to create a few major test plan categories (TP).

Then you would start to invent and plan use cases which can be made step
by step, every time the same way with each step either PASS or FAIL, no
ambiguity. These are called Test Cases (TC). Each Test Case must belong
to a Test Suite (TS). Typically, you would execute all the test cases in
a test suite, so don't make too big Test Suites. Each Test Suite must
belong to a Test Plan.

Test Plan -> (n) x Test Suites Test Suites -> (n) x Test Cases

Don't worry about the steps in use cases too much. You can add new steps
later on and then just make a new test run:

You would create a Test Run, typically that contains all the tests in
the Test Suite. Once you encounter a FAIL in a test step, stop: go to
GitHub, create an issue for bug. It would have, say number #71. In your
Test Case, you scroll down and you would Add a Defect. It asks you for a
number, now give it number 71. You get the GitHub issue which you can
resolve or leave for the future.

Test run = select Test -Suite -> execute all (n) x Test Cases in it
(Skipping allowed if you want to verify a fix of a single bug).

If you leave a bug fix for the future: after the fix, make a new Test
Run, skip to the Use Case you are verifying the Defect # and then, at
this failed step point, verify that it now PASS: In Defects click on the
"71" defect: in the dialog mark it as resolved /fixed/cosed and leave a
comment. GitHub will be updated automatically.

It would help that if you define milestones, and use those for each test
run, telling to which milestone (next milestone is usually next planned
version) it belongs to. Then you would use in GitHub issues the same
milestone number (in Issues).

Simple!

== Collaborate on Test Quality

Good Testing is an intensive and complex process, and experienced help
is always welcome. The more people testing the better the software. This
tool promises to be very useful establishing and tracking the tests
needed, defining, refining and implementing the necessary tests. It can
communicate the tests needed to others and how they should be done step
by step.

To collaborate and help on another person's TestQuality project, create
a login on that person's testquality site [username].testquality.com
using another or different email.
