Plugin Dev executes script to copy Cloudsmith metadate files to https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins[OpenCPN Container Project for an Integrated Plugin Management Facility] {github.com/opencpn/plugins) so they can be added to the **Plugin Management User Interface**.





== CIRCLECI (Build Account)

. Open a (free) open-source account on circleci.com
https://circleci.com/signup/[Signup] with your GitHub account
. You will be allowing CircleCI certain types of access to your GitHub
account.
. Start following your GitHub plugin project on Circleci.
. In CircleCI

....
    - Under settings create a "context" with [username]
    - Prerequisites: Config.yml uses workflows and you must be an admin.
    - Under settings "Enable Github Checks" [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/enable-checks/#section=projects|https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/enable-checks/#section=projects]]
    - Under Settings > VCS > "Manage Github Checks"? Yes
    - [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#section=projects|Environment Settings and API tokens]]
    - Context- Contexts provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. The environment variables are defined as name/value pairs and are injected at runtime. [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/|https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/]]
- In **//Project > Build Settings > Build Settings > Environmental Variables//**  to set up security.
- See [[:opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installler_build_deploy#cloudsmith_api_key_generation_and_use|CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY Generation and Use]]
- Add environment variables to the job. You can add sensitive data (e.g. API keys) here, Private environment variables enable you to store secrets safely even when your project is public, see Building Open Source Projects for associated settings information. Use Contexts to further restrict access to environment variables from within the build, refer to the "Restricting a Context" documentation.
- [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/oss/|Building Open Source Projects]]
- Put your //**Cloudsmith Deployment Key**//  in your //**Circleci account> Settings> [user]> squiddio_pi> Env Variables**//  as "CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY" .
- The squiddio_pi/ci/circleci-upload.sh file uses the name "CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY"
- Typical Setttings: Since building a PR is one way to make sure it works, if someone wants to help you out, therefor please enable the //Build forked pull requests//  option which should make circleci build all PRs. If //Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests//, is Disabled, it will not be able to upload anything.

== CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY Generation and Use

KEY #2 provides your BUILD service the ability to PUSH artifacts
(tarballs, xml, packages) to your CLOUDSMITH repository.

Provide your unique CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY to other services such as
CIRCLECI, TRAVIS and APPVEYOR to give them permission to DEPLOY to
CLOUDSMITH.

. Copy the API key from your CLOUDSMITH Account on
https://cloudsmith.io[https:__cloudsmith.io]] by - Get the key from
cloudsmith account page. Click the user name icon, upper right, and you
will be able to copy the key to clipboard. - Left click your logon-id in
the top right of the cloudsmith main page - Then click 'API Key' - You
will be asked for 'Elevated Privileges' and need to supply your
password. - Then your key will be displayed. - Copy this (either select
the whole key and copy or click the paper clip icon at the right hand
end of the key line) - Now use your Cloudsmith key in the appropriate
accounts below to provide access to Cloudsmith for deployment. - Sign
into your CIRCLECI account on
[[https:__circleci.com|https:__circleci.com]] * Select 'Settings' in the
left hand vertical toolbar * Then 'Projects' * Then the settings icon
(gear wheel) of the project (plugin_pi) you want to use. * Click
'Environment Variables' under 'BUILD SETTINGS', * Click "Add Variable" *
Paste the Cloudsmith key into the Value Field.. * Add
'CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY' into the Name Field. * Close by clicking Add
Variable. - Sign into your APPVEYOR account on appveyor.com
[[https:__appveyor.com|https:__appveyor.com]] * First add the plugin
project. The plugin name should show in the upper left. * From the
plugin page go to Settings in the top menu. * Select Environment from
the side menu. * Under Environment Variables select Add a Variable. *
Paste the Cloudsmith key into the Variable Field and enter
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY into the Name Field. * Click Add Variable. - Sign
into your TRAVIS account on
[[https:__travis-ci.org|https://travis-ci.org]

....
      * Select the plugin project so that it shows at the top.(eg: weather_routing_pi)
      * Select from the upper right "More Options". Then "Settings" from the dropdown.
      * Scroll down to Environment Variables.
      * Paste the Cloudsmith key into the Value Field and enter CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY into the Name Field.
      * I select All Branches.
      * Select Add. See the screenshot.
....

Key,width=400]

Once this is done the deploy to Cloudsmith should work.


Also, for manual actions, at the bottom of the packages list page,
there's an "X Per Page" selector, where you can change the setting from
25 packages to 500. So if you really needed a manual action to
delete/copy/move many packages at once, you can do it like that.

== Setup: Configure Plugin for PI Installer

== Summary of Process

. Configure your plugin's files by replacing cmake and circleci scripts
and modify them appropriately.
. Create free opensource accounts with circleci and cloudsmith, and set
up opensource repositories.
. Test building and deployment to the cloudsmith "beta" repository.
. Use Opencpn with the PI Installer to open the new [ocpn-plugin.xml
metadata catalog to confirm installation and test the plugin.
. After testing, issue a new version, pushing new binaries to cloudsmith
repositories, along with a new ocpn-plugin.xml catalog file.
. See xref:pi_installer_procedure.adoc[PI Installer Procedure Build-Deploy]
 below, for more detail.

== Add CMake and Script Files

FIXME

Your plugin will need to be augmented with new CMake and script files.
There are two versions you can select from Frontend1 and Frontend2.

. The main Frontend1 example is in
https://github.com/bdbcat/oesenc_pi[github.com\bdbcat\oesenc_pi] and a
more annotated version is in
https://github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi/tree/frontend1[rgleason/squiddio_pi
branch frontend1]
. The main Frontend2 example is in
https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi[github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi]
and more annotated
ashttps://github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi/tree/frontend2[github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi
Branch frontend2]

The simplest way is to copy the new files in ci & cmake to your system
and make the requisite changes to the CMakeLists.txt, of which there
shouldn't be too many as it is really the individual plugins file, i.e.
has all the customization in.

All changes for customisation should be constrained to the
CMakeLists.txt file, because all the other files are parameter driven
and so 'should' be the same between plugins. So all the files in the:

. 'cmake' directory, including the in-files directory, are the same for
every plugin, there should be no customisation to these files. There are
'extra' cmake files which a plugin may use, i.e. FindPortaudio.cmake for
the weather_routing_pi, but these are supplied by the plugin and are
referenced vis CMakeLists.txt in the plugin customisation section.
. 'ci' directory should not require hand customisation as again all the
files are parameter (global variable) driven
. '.circleci' directory should not require hand customisation as again
all the files are parameter (global variable) driven
. 'debian' directory should not require hand customisation
. 'mingw' directory should not require hand customisation

Updates of plugins require copying the above directories in place and
then carefully updating the CMakeLists.txt file by referencing the
testplugin_pi version to change it to the new format and include all the
'standard' parts that are needed. It should be quite easy to get it
working, while testing on the web takes longer as jobs need to finish,
to determine what needs fixing.

So if you look through the first section of the CMakeLists.txt you will
see where you set the cloudsmith user and repository name as well as the
'special' stuff for the xml file. The next section down you may need to
change a few default settings, i.e. 'USE_GL', or some special version of
c++ that is needed. In the current file the following section (line 194
onwards) is where you define all the files to be used. You will need to
keep 'SRCS' as the source list, but the rest of it is up to you. You
will also need the last section which does the rest of the build and
package process.

I would not try to 'combine' this process with any other in the same
'stream' or you are likely to have problems. When I make changes just
copy the new files in place and, if needed, make the co-requisite
changes to CMakeLists.txt .

The idea of this process is that it is a 'black box' to most and it
should 'just work'. You will notice that I have changed the names of the
repositories to '…-prod', '…-beta' and '…-alpha', it just seemed to
match what was going into them. The destination repository is controlled
by what you are doing, i.e. -

....
  Any non-master branch network build -> alpha repository
  Master build without tag and non-master branch build with tag -> beta repository
  Master build with tag -> prod repository

....

All 'installation' files, 'deb', 'dmg', 'exe', etc will also go into the
same repository, but they will have the current naming strategy, i.e.
will start with 'opencpn-plugin-' the the rest of the descriptive name.

Download and Use the CMake and CI files listed below from Jon Gough's
https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi[Testplugin_pi] using the
"cmake_flatpak_test" branch. Download and install the files into a new
branch on your plugin local repository.

....

== Modify Files

Then the top of CMakeLists.txt must be customized for the plugin and
environment. There are basically two sets of files for CMake that have
been developed. One set comes from Alex Leamas and the other set comes
from Jon Gough's testplugin_pi which is being used as a template. Jon
has gone to some effort to bring all the Plugin Dev settings up to the
top of CMakeLists.txt The example below is from Jon's testplugin_pi but
needs to be updated!

=== circleci\config.yml

Your account does not have rights to run macos until CircleCI staff
explicitly enables it. If you don't have access to run the macOS
enviornment that particular build will not start but all the others
should run OK. *//Therefore comment out the build for "macos" lines,
until you ask for and are given permissions //* by them to run limited
use macos. *_First you need to create a real userid login in addition to
your github login to get MacOS._* See Build on

you need to write Circleci Support **//
to[[billing@circleci.com|billing@circleci.com] including your
"Opensource" account, stating that you are creating only public
OpenSource for OpenCPN and would like MacOS build capability.

Also write staff nicely asking if you can get permission for MacOS, and
stating that the plugin is opensource for OpenCPN.

== Other Notes

== Cloudsmith OpenCPN Organization

https://cloudsmith.io/orgs/opencpn/

There are 3 repositories that can be used.

Developers of Plugins can be invited to join the organization after they
have created an opensource Cloudsmiith account.

See this https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/1573

== Installation Destination change with Plugin Manager

https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/1605

Check your plugins for any changes needed to keep intended user
experience when installing, noting path isssues.

== Catalog XML "name" must match "Common Name"

The name used in the Plugin Manager XML Catalog must match the "Common
Name" of the plugin being installed.

In order for the Plugin Manager to work consistently, the "name" tag in
the catalog's XML must match the "Common Name" of the plugin being
installed. The (sometimes inconsistent) values in CmakeLists.txt do not
affect the plugin manager at run-time. Example catalog xml record:

....
<plugin version="1">
  <name> WeatherRouting </name>
  <version> 1.13.2 </version>
  <release> 0 </release>
