= Compile 2015 VS Community Workflow

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

== Aim

To show one workflow for setting up a Windows pc for compiling OpenCPN.

The pc used was a 'win-32-x86 machine', running Windows 8.1.

If you are running 'x64' you will need to download the 64 bit installers
for some of the programs used here. This applies to:

* Git
* CMake
* 7Zip

The steps will follow the instructions
xref:compiling_windows.adoc[here].

'Navigate' means using 'Windows Explorer' to find a folder or file.

'cd' or 'CD' is used in a Terminal window to 'change directory' (aka
'change folder')

== Method

* This assumes that you have accepted the suggested locations for
installing the various programs.

=== Install Visual Studio Community 2015

*https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/[https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads]*

* Download the installer.

image:vs2_download.png[vs2_download.png]

* Install Visual Studio by a double-click on the installer '.exe'. Use
the 'Custom' method and select the 'C++ language'. We are going to
continue trying to build a version of OpenCPN that will run on Windows
XP.
* Tick the box 'Windows XP Support for C++'

image:vs2_install.png[vs2_install.png]

'''''

*Note:*

* If you have used the default ('Typical') installer option you will
need to configure the program to use C++.
* Right-click the Windows icon (bottom left) Select 'Programs and
Features'. Select 'Microsoft Visual Community 2015 with Updates'.
Right-click 'Change'.

image:vs2_change.png[vs2_change.png]

* Tick the C++ language option
* You now have a lengthy wait while another install takes place
* Lesson … 'Use Custom'

'''''

=== Install Git

Get the Git installation packages from
*https://git-for-windows.github.io/*

* Install and let it register in the *PATH* environment variable
* The defaults for all the installation settings are fine except for
just the following:
* On the *Adjusting your PATH environment*, select *Run Git from the
Windows Command Prompt*.

image:git_command_prompt.png[git_command_prompt.png,width=513,height=399]

* On the *Choosing CR/LF behavior* select *Checkout as-is, Commit Unix
LF*.

image:git_commit_unix_lf.png[git_commit_unix_lf.png,width=513,height=399]

* This is really important, the codebase uses Unix LF line endings and
committing CR/LF makes the commits huge and hides their real content.

=== Install CMake

* Get the latest CMake installation packages from
*http://www.cmake.org/[http://www.cmake.org]*

image:cmake_web1.png[cmake_web1.png]

* *The installer used is shown at the bottom of this screenshot.*

image:cmake_web2.png[cmake_web2.png]

* *As part of the install choose this option:*

image:cmake_path.png[cmake_path.png]

* Install CMake and let it register the *'Path'* environment variable

=== Install Poedit

Get the latest 'Poedit' installation package from
http://www.poedit.net/[http://www.poedit.net]

. Install 'Poedit'.
. Add *'C:\Program Files\Poedit\GettextTools\bin'* to the *PATH*
environment variable.

* Select 'System' and in the left column click 'Advanced System
Settings'.

image:poedit_system.png[poedit_system.png]

* On the Advanced tab, click on the '*Environment Variables'* button.

image:poedit_system_environment.png[poedit_system_environment.png]

* Under **'System Variables' **find the **'Path' **system variable.
Press *'Edit'.*

image:poedit_system_environment_path.png[poedit_system_environment_path.png]

* In **'Variable value' *add '*;***C:\Program
Files\Poedit\GettextTools\bin'* to the end of the list. (The**
semicolon** is important!)

image:poedit_system_environment_path_edit.png[poedit_system_environment_path_edit.png]

* Press **'OK' **a number of times to save and exit.

**Note: **If you look in the '**C:\Program
Files\Poedit\GettextTools\****bin' **folder you will see the file
*'msgfmt.exe'* which does the work of the program.

=== Install NSIS

In case you want to create installation packages, install NSIS Unicode
2.46.5 from
*https://code.google.com/archive/p/unsis/downloads[http://www.scratchpaper.com/]*

* Choose the Unicode version for 'win32-x86'. All the default settings
can be accepted.

image:nsis_download.png[nsis_download.png]

There is a "bug" in CMake, which only looks at
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NSIS" for the installation location of NSIS

The Unicode version adds its registry key in
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NSIS\Unicode".

Some registry tweaking is needed.

* Open a 'Command Prompt' and type and run 'regedit'. This starts the
'Registry Editor'.

image:nsis_command_prompt.png[nsis_command_prompt.png]

* Navigate to *'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NSIS\Unicode'*. Double-click
on the 'Default' line.

*Note:* If you are running a 64-bit machine (x64) the key is located in
'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432node\NSIS\Unicode'

image:nsis_registry_double_click.png[nsis_registry_double_click.png]

* Copy the value (The installation path of NSIS).
* Navigate to *'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NSIS'*.

*Note:* If you are running a 64-bit machine (x64) the location is
'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432node\NSIS'.

image:nsis_value_not_set.png[nsis_value_not_set.png]

* Double-click on the 'Default' line and paste the install path into
'Value data'.

image:nsis_paste_value.png[nsis_paste_value.png]

To make the installer package use proper language name translations, it
is necessary to modify file **'C:\Program
Files\NSIS\Unicode\Contrib\Language files\Norwegian.nsh' **and change
the line

....
!insertmacro LANGFILE "Norwegian" "Norwegian"
....

to

....
!insertmacro LANGFILE "Norwegian" "Norsk"
....

The **'C:\Program Files\NSIS\Unicode\Contrib\Language
files\Norwegian.nsh' ** is edited.

Due to 'Security' you will need to add 'Write' permission to this file.
Without this you will not be able to save the changes.

* With 'Explorer' navigate to *'C:\Program
Files\NSIS\Unicode\Contrib\Language files\'.*
* Right-click on the file *'Norwegian.nsh'.*
* In 'Properties', 'Security' tab, press the 'Edit' button.

image:nsis_norsk_security.png[nsis_norsk_security.png]

* Select 'Users' and tick all the 'Allow' boxes.
* The **'C:\Program Files\NSIS\Unicode\Contrib\Language
files\Norwegian.nsh' ** can now be opened with 'WordPad' or 'Notepad'
and the changes made and saved.

image:nsis_norge.png[nsis_norge.png]

=== Compile wxWidgets 3.0.2

* Download the '3.0.2 release' as a *'zip'* file from
*http://wxwidgets.org/downloads/*
* Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the zip.
* Right-click on the file **'wxWidgets-3.0.2.zip' **and select the menu
option 'Extract All…'.

image:wxw_extract_all.png[wxw_extract_all.png]

* Edit the folder for the Destination to read 'C:\wxWidgets-3.0.2' and
press the 'Extract' button.

image:wxw_extract.png[wxw_extract.png]

==== Compile wxWidgets with Visual Studio Community 2015

* Find the Visual Studio solution ('sln') file in the folder
'C:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\build\msw'

image:wx2_sln_file.png[wx2_sln_file.png]

* Double click on the filename to open the solution in Visual Studio
* Decided to ignore the security warning

image:wx2_security.png[wx2_security.png]

* Some changes are needed to the source files (Credit to 'doublemax' on
forums.wxwidgets.org - topic 40491)

....
1) <wxdir>\src\zlib\gzguts.h - line 102
change:

Code: Select all
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#  define snprintf _snprintf
#endif

to:

Code: Select all
#if (defined(_MSC_VER) && (_MSC_VER <1900))
  #define snprintf _snprintf
#endif

2) <wxdir>\src\tiff\libtiff\tif_config.h - line 367
change:

Code: Select all
#define snprintf _snprintf

to:

Code: Select all
#if (defined(_MSC_VER) && (_MSC_VER <1900))
  #define snprintf _snprintf
#endif

3) <wxdir>\include\wx\propgrid\advprops.h - line 453
change:

Code: Select all
wxDateTime GetDateValue() const
{
    //return m_valueDateTime;
    return m_value;
}

to:

Code: Select all
wxDateTime GetDateValue() const
{
    //return m_valueDateTime;
    return m_value.GetDateTime();
}

Line numbers based on wxWidgets 3.0.2 (not the latest development version).
....

* Find the 3 pages using 'Solution Explorer'. The first 2 are under the
projects in 'Additional Dependencies'.
* Use the editor to make the changes. The changes are saved when you
build the solution.

image:wx2_changes.png[wx2_changes.png]

* On the Toolbar select 'Dll Debug'
* In Solution Explorer select all the projects from '_custom_build' down
to the bottom ('xrc'). You can do this by selecting the first project,
keeping the left button down and extending the highlight to the bottom
using the 'Down' key.
* Right click on the highlighted area. Select 'Properties',
'Configuration Properties', 'General'. Under 'Platform Toolset' use the
dropdown to select 'Visual Studio 2015-Windows XP (v140_xp)'
* 'Apply', 'OK'

image:wx2_highlight_toolset-release.png[wx2_highlight_toolset-release.png]

* At the top of the window select 'Build', 'Build Solution'
* Run the 'Dll Debug' build

image:wx2_buiild_debug.png[wx2_buiild_debug.png]

* Follow the same steps for 'Dll Release', which will make the build
compatible with Windows XP.
* Run 'Build', 'Build Solution'
* Save and close the solution

image:wx2_close_vs.png[wx2_close_vs.png]

You will find that a number of files have been made in the folder
*'c:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\lib\vc-dll'*.

Some of the filenames start 'wxmsw30u' and others 'wxmsw30ud'
corresponding to the 'Release' and 'Debug' versions.

image:wxw_files_made.png[wxw_files_made.png]

*This completes the preparations for building the OpenCPN program.*

== Building OpenCPN

=== Get the OpenCPN source

* Make a folder to store your OpenCPN source code files. In this guide I
am going to call it 'Example' in the root folder, i.e.**
'C:\Example\'**.
* Start a 'Command Prompt' (Any prompt will work - just right-click on
your Window icon) and select 'Command Prompt'. A Terminal window will
appear.

image:git_wcommand_prompt.png[git_wcommand_prompt.png]

* CD to the 'Example' folder. (Type 'cd C:\Example' and press 'Enter').

image:git_cd_example.png[git_cd_example.png]

* Type this text into the Terminal window and press 'Enter'.

git clone git://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git

* This will download the latest Beta code.

image:git_clone_opencpn.png[git_clone_opencpn.png]

* The files/folders for building 'OpenCPN' will be placed in the folder
'C:\Example\OpenCPN'
* If you are happy to work with the Beta version source code … move on
to the
xref:compiling_windows-steps-example.adoc[next section].


*Note:* If you want the source code for the latest stable release (4.4.0
at time of writing) you need to locate that source on GitHub.com:

https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/tree/v4.4.0

* Press the 'Clone or download' button. *DO NOT* use the text for 'git
clone' or you will get the Beta version. Instead …
* Select 'Download Zip' and save the zip file.

image:git_clone_download_44.png[git_clone_download_44.png]

* Extract the files to the folder 'C:\Example'

image:git_zip_extract.png[git_zip_extract.png]

* The files/folders for building 'OpenCPN' will be placed in the folder
'C:\Example\OpenCPN-4.4.0'
* These are the files that are going to be used for this workflow. This
folder is renamed 'C:\Example\OpenCPN' to make the process steps read in
the same way as for the files from 'git clone' (the Beta version).

'''''

== Get the binary dependency files

Sorry, this needs another program - *7Zip.*

* Get the installer from http://www.7-zip.org/download.html[here.]
* 7z files are compressed files making them smaller and faster to
download. The '7Zip' program allows you to extract the original files.
image:7z_download.png[7z_download.png]

* After the download double-click the '7z….exe' file to carry out the
installation.
* You need to restart the computer.

image:7z_restart.png[7z_restart.png]

*'7z'* files can now be opened and extracted with this program.

* Download
*http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/opencpn_packaging_data/OpenCPN_buildwin.7z/download[OpenCPN_buildwin.7z]*

image:o_build_win.png[o_build_win.png]

* Right-click on this file in 'Windows Explorer'. Select the option
'7-Zip', 'Extract Files'.

image:7z_extract_build_win.png[7z_extract_build_win.png]

* Select the folder 'C:\Example\OpenCPN. The files and folders from the
7z file will be placed under that
directory image:7z_extract_folder.png[7z_extract_folder.png]

* Uncheck the box next to the text 'OpenCPN_buildwin'.

image:7z_extract_build_win2.png[7z_extract_build_win2.png]

* Use the 'No to All' button to avoid overwriting files in the source.

image:bw_overwrite.png[bw_overwrite.png]

* This will add extra files in the folder 'C:\Example\OpenCPN\buildwin'
that are needed for the build.

=== Make a Visual Studio solution for building OpenCPN

* Start the VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt

image:vs2_command_prompt.png[vs2_command_prompt.png]

* The command prompt shortcut is in the folder
'C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Visual Studio
2015\Visual Studio Tools\Windows Desktop Command Prompts'

image:vs2_prompt_location.png[vs2_prompt_location.png]

* Change Directory [cd] into 'C:\Example\OpenCPN'.
* Create a folder named "build" under this topmost source folder.

....
mkdir build
....

* cd to the "build" folder and then issue the cmake command shown.

....
cd build
cmake -T v140_xp ..
....

image:o2_buiild.png[o2_buiild.png]

image:o_build_solution_finished.png[o_build_solution_finished.png]

* Close the Terminal window. +
* This has created the Visual Studio solution file 'OpenCPN.sln'.

image:o2_solution_file.png[o2_solution_file.png]

=== Build OpenCPN

* Open the '.sln' file with the program Visual Studio Community 2015
(you can double-click the file name)
* The program window should look like this:

image:vs_open_solution.png[vs_open_solution.png]

* Set the project 'opencpn' as the 'Startup Project

image:vs_startup_project.png[vs_startup_project.png]


* A number of additional dependencies need to be added to the following
projects

* dashboard
* grib_pi
* opencpn

....
wxmsw30u_richtext.lib
wxmsw30u_adv.lib
wxmsw30u_propgrid.lib
wxmsw30u_aui.lib
....

* Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer
* Select 'Properties', 'Linker Input', 'Additional Dependencies'
* Use the drop down to insert the '.lib' files shown above

image:vs2015_additional_depends.png[vs2015_additional_depends.png]


* To avoid problems later please check the following options are set
correctly
* Select 'Tools', 'Options'
* Check the settings are the same as shown in these two screenshots

image:/opencpn/dev/developer_guide/compiling_windows/vs2015_line_endings.png[vs2015_line_endings.png]

image:/opencpn/dev/developer_guide/compiling_windows/vs2015_tabs.png[vs2015_tabs.png]

'''''

* From the top of the window choose 'Build', 'Solution'.
* You will be making a 'Debug' version of the program.

image:vs_build_debug.png[vs_build_debug.png]

* The build will take some time but the result should be like this:

image:vs_debug_success.png[vs_debug_success.png]

* All is going well. The release version will now be made.
* Change the 'Dropdown' from 'Debug' to 'Release'.

image:vs_release.png[vs_release.png]

* From the top of the window choose 'Build', 'Solution' again.

image:vs_release_success.png[vs_release_success.png]

* Two new folders have appeared in 'C:\Example\OpenCPN\build', called
'Release' and 'Debug'.

== Make a package to install OpenCPN

This assumes that you have installed 'NSIS' (The guide was
link:compiling_windows-steps-example.adoc[here]).

* The folder 'C:\Example\OpenCPN\buildwin\wxwidgets' has 16 wxWidgets
'.dll' files
* Replace these with the same dll files found in
'C:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\lib\vc_dll'. If this is not done now they will not
be included in the package and will have to be copied later.

image:wx2_replace_dlls.png[wx2_replace_dlls.png]

* In Visual Studio Solution Explorer you will see a project called
'PACKAGE'.
* Right-click 'PACKAGE'. Choose 'Project Only', 'Build Only PACKAGE'

image:vs_package.png[vs_package.png]

* Run this option.

image:vs_package_built.png[vs_package_built.png]

* This will produce an installer 'setup.exe' in the folder
'C:\Example\OpenCPN\build\'

image:vs_package_location.png[vs_package_location.png]

== Install OpenCPN

* Double click the setup .exe
* Accept the default settings
* The installation will complete with this page

image:o_installed.png[o_installed.png]

* Run the finished program

image:o_success.png[o_success.png]

*OpenCPN (Version 4.4.0) and the four plugins included in the source
files have been built successfully.*

'''''

**In order to run the setup on Windows XP it is necessary to download
and run the ***'Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015*' *installer*

*This was downloaded from
http://standaloneofflineinstallers.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/Microsoft-Visual-C-Redistributable-2015-2013-2012-2010-2008-2005-32-bit-x86-64-bit-x64-Standalone-Offline-Installer-for-Windows.html[here].
I had problems with the version I found elsewhere on Microsoft.*
