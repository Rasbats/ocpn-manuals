= Fork and Build (Linux)

== Requirements

* Register with GitHub and obtained a profile. This allows the setting
up of repositories where your code can be published.
* Git
* CMake

== Process

* Using GitHub and working from your main GitHub folder make a fork of
DR_pi from https://github.com/Rasbats/DR_pi

* Using 'Terminal' clone the plugin onto your machine:

* Make the 'build' directory and cd to 'build':

* 'CMake' a 'CodeBlocks' project:

* To see what files have been made use 'Files' to navigate to
'learning/DR_pi/build'. The 'CodeBlocks' project is called 'DR_pi.cbp'.

* Start 'CodeBlocks' and 'Build' the project.

* There are some warnings but no errors.

* This builds the plugin file 'libDR_pi.so' in the 'build' directory

* The .so file can be moved to the plugins folder 'usr/lib/opencpn'
using 'Terminal'.

== Alternative plugin installation using the Software Centre

* It may be easier to make a package and install this using the 'Ubuntu
Software Centre'.

* From 'Terminal', in 'build', 'sudo make install', 'sudo make package'.
The .deb package is made in the 'build' folder.

* Open the .deb file from 'build' in the 'Ubuntu Software Centre'.

* A warning

* Carry on!

* The plugin libDR_pi.so has been installed in '/usr/lib/opencpn'.

* When you enable the DR plugin you should see the plugin icon on the
toolbar.

== Notes

The next guide will show the DR_pi plugin being renamed as
'oplaydo1_pi' and modified. 

'oplaydo1_pi' will allow the user to input start and finish positions.
From these positions a GPX file will be created that can be imported and
viewed in OpenCPN.
