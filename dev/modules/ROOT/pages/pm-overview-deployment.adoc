= Plugin Manager Deployment Overview

The Plugin Manager (PM) installer is, from 5.2.0 the normal way to
install plugins. The installer is designed around some concepts:

Tarball::
A tarball is (in this context) the complete plugin which the installer
installs. It is basically the result of `make install` packed together
with metadata. The layout is fixed and documented in
xref:plugin-installer:ROOT:Tarballs.adoc[here]

Metadata::
The plugin metadata contains plugin name, version and an url from which
the tarball can be downloaded. These are a central parts, but there is
more defined as documented  xref:plugin-installer:ROOT:Catalog.adoc[here]

Catalog::
The catalog is the list of plugins available for an OpenCPN installation.
The UI in the program, a list of plugins, is based on the catalog.

Librarian::
The librarian, really Dave, manages the catalog which is continously
updated.


The flow from developer to user of a plugin:

* Developer updates the plugin code, commits and pushes to Github.

* The commit on Github activates the CI builders, like CircleCI (there
  is typically more of them), which starts building the plugin for various
  platforms.

* Each CI build results in a tarball and a metadata file for a specific
  platform.

* The tarball is uploaded to Cloudsmith, a binary repository from which
  users can download it.

* The metadata is sent to the librarian who reviews it.

* If accepted, the librarian merges the metadata into the catalog.

* User updates the catalog regularly, downloading the last version of the
  catalog to the computer.

* When there is a need, user locates a plugin to download in the catalog.
  Catalog metadata provides the url which is used to download and install
  the plugin.

A lot of services are mentioned in this text. However, these are just
examples, source code could be stored anywhere, other CI builders (or none)
could be used and the binary content can be stored anywhere. The only fixed
point is the catalog.
