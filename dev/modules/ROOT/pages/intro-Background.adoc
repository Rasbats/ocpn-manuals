Dave Register, a programmer, and Kathi began full time cruising in
2000 aboard http://bigdumboat.com/faq.html[m/v Dyad]]. Dave wasn't
satisfied with the commercial chart plotters available. He began to
develop his own and named it OpenCPN. For years, OpenCPN was their own
personal chart plotter. It reliably got them to wherever they were headed;
from Newfoundland to the Bahamas. The public wasn't even aware of it at
the time.

Dave began sharing the program with other cruisers here and there, which
planted the idea to put it out publicly for anyone to download as open
source. It's first online presence was on Dave's website,
http://bigdumboat.com/[bigdumboat.com]. https://opencpn.org[OpenCPN.org]
was created in 2009.

The program now has a worldwide following, and a team of brilliant
volunteer developers.

== Recipient of the 2018 Ocean Cruising Club Award

On January 22, 2018 the OCC announced that
http://oceancruisingclub.org/newsitem/211/The-OCC-Award-goes-to-David-Register-for-OpenCPN?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter[Dave Register is the recipient of the OCC Award].
"I'm honored and humbled. But I'm only the tip of an iceberg. This award
and recognition would not be possible without the help and support of
the worldwide OpenCPN team. Thank you."

OpenCPN is chart plotter and navigational planning software developed by
a team of active sailors using real world conditions for program testing
and refinement. Their motto: â€œWe're boaters. We're coders.
...A network of more than forty volunteer software coders now work to
improve the product, update it and expand its capabilities. Dave continues
to co-ordinate this work from his floating home, Dyad, the Big Dumb Boat.
See https://www.bigdumboat.com/[https://www.bigdumboat.com/]
...Open CPN has made a magnificent contribution to the enjoyment and safety
of sailors cruising in small boats, and Dave deserves every bit of
recognition for his invention and his ongoing efforts."
