== General

So, you are thinking about joining the OpenCPN project? You are most
welcome! There are many ways to participate, most of which not requiring
programming skills -- see TBD.

This manual is about contributing to the code.

OpenCPN is an open-source project. The core parts uses a GPL version 2 or later
license (GPLv2+), but there are a lot of other licenses in dependencies used.
Contributions to the project must be licensed under an open-source license,
normally GPLv2+.

The starting point for developer activities is in many cases the OpenCPN forum
at https://opencpn.org/flyspray/index.php?project=0&do=index[FlySpray].
Here, end-user reports problems and sometimes also submits enhancement
requests (RFEs).

== The core OpenCPN project

For the core OpenCPN project development work is done on the
https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN[OpenCPN Github site]. Github issues
are filed for more specific problems or RFEs. Pull requests (PR) is
the way used to include patches and new functionality into the
program.

The project has no common communication channel lika a mailing list or
a developer forum; the core synchronization tool is Github issues.

xref:devel_manual#_thank_you_dave[Dave] (@bdbcat) is the lead developer
and makes decisions on if/when/how to merge a PR. Also
https://github.com/nohal[Pavel] (@nohal) has commit rights in the
project. There are no formal roles besides these.

To contact the project as a developer, filing issues and/or making
comments on existing ones is the easiest way to join the community.

== Plugins

The community also has a vast number of
https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=opencpn[Plugins on Github].
Development of plugins is highly de-centralized and each plugin
effectively forms a separate community. Also plugins tends to use
Github issues and PR to synchronize work and submit code.
