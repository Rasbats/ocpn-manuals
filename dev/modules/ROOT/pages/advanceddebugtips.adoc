== How to use CI Tools: Appveyor

Bdbcat has responded to several questions, explaining how these features
should be used.

{empty}1. How to get Alpha/Beta Testers familiar with Github and
locating those compiled files?

* When we are actually in Beta test, we will describe the process and condition of the CI artifacts. 
* We may use the artifacts then, but probably not. 
* We have enough trouble tracking issues with one "official" Beta location. 
* Using the almost daily updates of CI product for Beta testing would be a nightmare.
* Best to think of the usefulness of CI as we are right now: In Alpha test of some new features, some of which features are known to be incomplete or even with known heinous errors.

{empty}2. Are these eventually going to be the source for the Website
Downloads page?

* No. The CI artifacts result from building the current github HEAD. 
* This, in general, will not be the same as the in-production Release point.

=== Summary

Testing a CI Product is like sneaking a spoon-sip of the dinner
simmering on the stove while Mom is not looking. She knows it needs
salt, and is way too hot to eat yet. If you drop dead immediately, she
wants to know about it. Otherwise, she wants to not hear too many
comments. Wait until it comes to the table. Meanwhile, go outside and
play....

== How CI Tools work

Using an example from Sean's Weatherfax plugin.

For Windows, use Appveyor.

=== 1. Go to Sean's Weatherfax_pi github repository

https://github.com/seandepagnier/weatherfax_pi

=== 2. Click on the Code Tab

Select the "Branch" you want to be on, most of the time it will be
"master"

=== 3. Click on the "Commits" Link

https://github.com/seandepagnier/weatherfax_pi/commits/master

image:ci-2.png[CI-2,width=600]

=== 4. Find the most recent commit

Lets say it is *"yet more inlines"* from Feb 11 2018

=== 5. Click on the Green Check at the end

A popup for the Continuous Integration Links for TravisCI and AppVeyor
come up.

The page will come up with the "Console" Tab.

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/seandepagnier/weatherfax-pi/build/1.0.13

=== 7. Click on the "Artifacts" Tab

To get to the download executable.

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/seandepagnier/weatherfax-pi/build/1.0.13/artifacts

You should then be able to download the weatherfax_pi-1.8.001-win32.exe
by clicking on it.
