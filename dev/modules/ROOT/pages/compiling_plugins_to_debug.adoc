= Compile Plugins for Debugging

== Plugin Debug Configuration inline with Opencpn

 +
== Why? ===

*The reason we want to do this is to find bugs in a plugin!!!*

External Standalone Plugins which need debugging generally should be
compiled within an existing operational OpenCPN Debug environment in
order to be debugged and have the code fixed. To do this you first need
to have a working
xref:compiling_windows.adoc[Windows
Development Environment for Compiling using MS Visual Studio 2013].

**Finding Errors & Fixing them ** +
We need the errors in the form of a filename and which line(s)
specifically, and preferably a copy of the "call stack" The next step is
to actually fix the problem and test again. All of this is done easiest
in a single development environment as described below.

*Standalone Plugin Compilation for Release.* +
If you have a plugin that is mature and just needs to be compiled for
windows release and NSIS packaged then compiling in the
xref:compiling_external_plugins_and_building_install_packages.adoc[standalone
configuration] is generally easiest and quickest.

*Standalone Plugin Compilation for Debug.* It is perfectly reasonable to
compile a standalone plugin for debugging and then copy the dll and data
to the source\build\plugin directory and then run cmake -T v120_xp ..
from source\build, then open MS Visual Studio, build and then _Debug >
Start_ Debugging. +
 +
=== Conceptual: How do we configure for Plugin Debugging? ====

External Plugins which need debugging should be setup in the same or
similar structure to the way the 4 Internal Plugins are setup. See the
bottom of
xref:compiling_windows[Setup
Batch Files] for a 4 Internal Plugins Table which shows source and
destination directories.

Example of a "Source" Directory under github:

....
  C:\users\[username]\Documents\GitHub\obeta\**source** 
  source\plugins               <-- Git clone https:\\username\name_pi into here.
  source\buildwin              <-- name_pi binaries & special dlls, exe put here.
  source\build                 <-- cmake commands are executed from this directory.
  source\build\plugins         <-- copy name_pi.dll from the directory below to here.
  source\build\plugins\debug   <-- copy compiled debug name_pi.dll from here
  source\build\plugins\release <-- copy compiled release name_pi.dll from here
  source\build\release         <-- copy buildwin binaries & dlls to here for running release.
  source\build\release\plugins<--copy release name_pi.dll to here + source\plugins\name_pi\data\*.*.
....

The *source* might be named OpenCPN

Use the command prompt to git clone the plugin into source\plugins

....
cd  source\plugins
Git Clone https:\\github.com\username\name_pi
Git Fetch
....

Now new source files and directories are found under
source\plugins\name_pi. +
This folder contains the data folder and other files necessary for cmake
and compilation. +
The git clone plugin files are located in the same directory as the
sourced internal plugin files.

Assuming a fresh git clone & install, run

....
mkdir build
cd build
CMake -T v120_xp ..
CMake --build . --config debug
CMake --build . --config debug
....

A new Plugins folder is created build\plugins\name_.pi directory with
subfolders "debug" and "release"

....
**source**\build\**plugins**\name_pi\**DEBUG**\name_pi.DLL 
....

So that MS VStudio Debug Build can run the four debug plugins we need to
copy the DEBUG version of name_pi.dll up several levels to

....
**source**\build\**plugins**\name_pi.DLL
....

Also this name_pi.DLL needs its corresponding DATA directory from
source\plugins\name_pi\DATA\*.* copied into the same
source\build\plugins directory.

A similar structure occurs for running a Release version, but the
destination is source\build\release\plugins. However we are not
interested in release versions here. We should follow the pattern for
debugging. +
 +
 +
==== 1. Step by Step, For real, not difficult, if the plugin works ====

Which Plugins directory to use for git clone & debugging?

....
source\plugins
....

in MS VS Command Prompt, navigate to *source\plugins*

....
git clone https:\\github.com\[username]\[name]_pi
....

Example:

....
cd  C:\Users\[username]\Documents\GitHub\obeta\OpenCPN\plugins
git clone https://github.com/seandepagnier/projections_pi
Cloning into 'vdr_pi'...
..
Unpacking objects: 100% (70/70), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
....

We now have a "source\plugins\projections_pi directory" with files and
possibly a "data" directory +
We have the necessary files and folder to CMake and compile.

. If it exists, Copy the source\plugins\name_pi\data\*.* to
source\build\plugins\name_pi\data
. Read name_pi README for necessary binaries & dlls.
. Next download any required windows binaries & dlls listed in the
plugin README
. Expand binaries and place them in the source\buildwin directory.
. Also copy them to source\build and source\build\release.

The projections_pi plugin has not DATA directory and requires no
binaries. +
CMake can now be run. +
 +
==== 2. Run CMake & Compile ====

....
cd ..
cd build   to source\build
cmake -T v120_xp ..
cmake --build . --target package --config release
cmake --build . --config debug
....

Projections_pi did complete successfully with 0 Errors and 0 Warnings.

However the 5 plugins I tried first all had errors I could not figure
out. Errorsâ€¦ hmmm. These occur often due to the peculiarities of a
plugins. Various techniques are required to get the plugin going.

NOTE: If source\plugins\name_pi and source\build\plugins\name_pi is
removed you can start over with cmake -T v120_xp .. etc and build
successfully.

Once the plugin compiles successfully, with no errors, the compiled file
need to be copied before testing and debugging the plugin. +
 +
==== 3. Copy files and Setup for Debugging ====

....
Copy  source\build\plugins\name_pi\debug\name_pi.DLL  
TO  source\build\plugins\name_pi.DLL

Copy  source\plugins\name_pi\DATA\*.*  
TO  source\build\plugins\DATA
....

=== Alternative 1 - Create a link to the Debug DLL ===

TransmitterDan has suggested creating a link to point to the Debug DLL
in
http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/development-debugging-environment-setup-help-87680.html#post2339557[Cruiser
Forums Development Environment Thread]

When building plugins and debugging you can create a link to the plugin
thus you don't have to disturb the actual plugins folder.

. Less confusion, everything stays the same standalone pi and opencpn
debuging.
. Control of link from one place.
. Less copying of files/directories, thus keeping MSVS++ OpenCPN
pristine, without all the pi stuff.
. No need to copy the Debug dll and name_pi dir to source/build/plugins

Something like this should work:

....
  cd OpenCPN\plugins
  mklink /D vdr_pi c:\myplugins\vdr_pi
....

At this point Cmake will see *OpenCPN\plugins\vdr_pi* as a folder and it
will configure the plugin for building. Git will ignore
*OpenCPN\plugins\vdr_pi* however.

Then you should be able to build either from *\myplugins\vdr_pi* or you
can build from within the overall OpenCPN build. The link is the same as
being inline with OpenCPN except Git does see the link and shows it as
an untracked folder which is ok as far as I can tell.

To get rid of the link but not the plugin folder itself:

....
 cd OpenCPN\plugins
 rmdir vdr_pi 
....

 +
=== Alternative 2 - Modify Plugin Manager ===

Modify PluginManager to point to the debug DLL location. This section
should be modified with this added information, which adds the dll to
the plugin manager and permits MSVC++ to find and run the debug plugin.

See Cruiser Forum Post:
http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/navico-radar-plugin-v3-0-beta3-v3-907-released-190692.html#post2483769

"Normally from MSVS++ Run OpenCPN in debug mode with the plugin built
internally similar to Dashboard or Chartdownloader. To Debug externally
compiled Debug DLL's the process is slightly different.

. The plugin dll must be found by MSVC++ Opencpn, so pluginmanager must
be adjusted to find it.
. First compile the Standalone plugin for debug.
. Locate the debug dll and copy it to where pluginmanager is set to find
it.
. Then run MSVC++ OpenCPN in debug mode.
. Thus you must copy the debug.dll every time you build.

The easy way to avoid having to copy the Debug.dll every time is to make
a few changes in pluginmanager.cpp which has pluginmanager take care of
the dll copying, or to tell pluginmanager where to find the particular
debug.dll.

        if (0) { // Set 1 for BR24

                destf = Dest;
                destf << name << _T(".") << ext;
                x = wxCopyFile(f, destf, true);
                f = wxFindNextFile();
            }
            mess << _T(" and ") << name;
        }
        mess << _T(" copied to ") << Dest;
        //wxMessageBox(mess, _T("Debug - Plugin info"));  

    m_plugin_location = _T("C:\\Builds\\OCPN\\OpenCPN\\build\\plugins\\Debug_pi\\");
#endif
    #else
        m_plugin_location = plugin_dir;
    #endif

    wxString msg(_T("PlugInManager searching for PlugIns in location "));
    msg += m_plugin_location;
    wxLogMessage(msg);
....

For example BR24radar_pi is not included for the moment due to comment
of corresponding lines.

m_plugin_location = _T("C:\\Builds\\OCPN\\OpenCPN\\build\\plugins\\Debug_pi\\");
