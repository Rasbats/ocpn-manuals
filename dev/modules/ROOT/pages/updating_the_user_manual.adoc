= Updating the User Manual

FIXME - DO AFTER MIGRATION - This page needs to be continued and brought
up to date. Also confirming that the manual has been updated with all
from Release 4.1.1301 (4.2) Changelog forward to version 4.3, 4.4 and
4.5! A relatively big job requiring updates to the User Manual from v4.1
thru 4.5. This work will have to be done after migration. Also all the
plugin documentation needs review, update and improvement.

The user manual aims to correctly describe all features of OpenCPN that
directly affect users. To do this it's essential to keep track of the
beta development and discussions.
Of course there are issues of style, language and other things as well,
but here we concentrate on the technical issues.

This is the way I've done it so far. First a quick and dirty scan to
mark those issues that require a documentation change. See below. These
are marked with a "*". All points referring to FS# then require checking
the FS# issue to reassess if a change is needed.
Examples.
#1 clearly needs a change as this is a new feature with user
configurations.
#13 does not require a change as it's a bugfix that makes O behave as
reasonably expected.
#37 is not straight forward and requires study of FS# and the patch to
see if a documentation change is needed.
...and so on.
Once the change is done, I mark each issue with a "#" as well. So when
the changes required by: "*1, Implement configurable waypoint range
rings (FS#1560)", is done it will look like this.
"#*1. Implement configurable waypoint range rings (FS#1560)".

Making the changes requires a thorough understanding of the issue,
gained by testing O and reading everything that is available, including
the code, even if you're not a C++ coder, as there are often valuable
comments in the code. If this is not enough ask the developers, until
everything is clear.

Looking again at all the changes, one big thing that is not instantly
obvious, is that OpenCPN now badly needs documentation for Android
users.
