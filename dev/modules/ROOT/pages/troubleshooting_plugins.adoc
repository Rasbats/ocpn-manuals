= Troubleshooting Plugins


== Dependency bundling

* xPlugins must maintain their own local copies of all the files
  they need to build, independent of the main OCPN source tree"

Take a look at Dashboard. It contains local copies of all the NMEA
decoding classes, and they are simply clones of the same files in the
base code. Not links. That's the way our PlugIn API works. +

And another view: Unless a Plugin changes its API revision requirement,
there _must_ be no need to re-build a Plugin for a new base version. We
promise backward compatibility this way. +


* Blacklist

Plugins, or versions of plugins, known to create problems for users, can
be blacklisted. +
This means they will not load, and a warning will be issued. For current
list check "pluginmanager.h" line ~70.
