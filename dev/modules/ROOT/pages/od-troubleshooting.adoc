= Troubleshooting

For trouble shooting and lower level nitty gritty details, the command
line, configuration files and debuggers are your friends.

== OpenCPN has a minimal command line interface (CLI)
  Usage: opencpn [-h] [-p] [-fullscreen] [-no_opengl] [-rebuild_gl_raster_cache] [-parse_all_enc] [-l <str>] [-unit_test_1 <num>] [-unit_test_2] [--unit_test_2] [-safe_mode] [import GPX files...]
    -h, --help              	Show usage syntax.
    -p                      	Run in portable mode.
    -fullscreen             	Switch to full screen mode on start.
    -no_opengl              	Disable OpenGL video acceleration. This setting will be remembered.
    -rebuild_gl_raster_cache	Rebuild OpenGL raster cache on start.
    -parse_all_enc          	Convert all S-57 charts to OpenCPN's internal format on start.
    -l, --loglevel=<str>    	Amount of logging: error, warning, message, info, debug or trace
    -unit_test_1:<num>      	Display a slideshow of <num> charts and then exit. Zero or negative <num> specifies no limit.
    -unit_test_2
    --unit_test_2
    -safe_mode

=== -l, --loglevel=<str>

Set the amount of logged information. The source code contains
wxLogInfo(), wxLogDebug() and wxLogTrace() statements. Setting the loglevel
to `info`, the default, only prints wxLogInfo() messages in the log.
Setting it to `debug` makes the wxLogDebug() messages appear,
and likewise for `trace` and wxLogTrace()

=== -unit_test_1

This command test cycles through all possible charts in the currently
loaded chart database, adjusting the viewport to show the loaded chart
automatically. The value of this test is clear: it provide an unattended
stress test of OpenCPN, It is most fun to watch in quilt modeâ€¦

The test runs until all charts in the database have been visited once.
Lets think of this as a Beta test tool.

A side-effect of this switch is that it can be used to process a set of
ENC charts into SENC files. The first, time consuming processing of ENC
charts, can this way be done unattended.

=== -p

The portable option is explained in.
https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:advanced_features:portable_opencpn_v2[]
Basically, it allows OpenCPN to run just using local data directories for
example on a USB stick.

=== -no_opengl

A total switch-off of OpenGL, in a more thorough way than in "Options".

=== -fullscreen

Starts OpenCPN in FullScreen mode

===  -safe_mode

Start OpenCPN without OpenGL and without loading any plugins.

== Debugging Output Settings for Logfile

The _config or ini_ file contains a lot of settings that are saved
between sessions.
*Debug statements can be added to produce a lot of output when problems
arises in certain areas.*
The following statement are recognized and can be added to the config
file before a session starts.

  [Settings] ...
  DebugNMEA=500   Writes 500 NMEA sentences to the log file\\
  DebugCM93=1     Writes volumes of debug info relating to CM93 to the logfile.\\
  DebugS57        Add logfile debug output for S57\\
  DebugGDAL       Add logfile debug output for GDAL\\

== Using a FIFO for ais debugging.

See the code in _ais.cpp_:

   A special test for a user defined FIFO
   To use this method, do the following:
   a.  Create a fifo            $mkfifo /tmp/aisfifo
   b.  netcat into the fifo     $nc $ip $port> /tmp/aisfifo
                   sample ip port could be  nc 82.182.117.51 6401 > /tmp/aisfifo
   c.  hand edit opencpn.conf and make AIS data source like this:
        [Settings/AISPort]
        Port=Serial:/tmp/aisfifo

  This also works if you have an ascii ais log
  for which you can simply $cat ais.log> /tmp/aisfifo

You may see that if the port name contains the string "fifo", then the
requirement for the port to be a TTY is relaxed.

== wxWidgets

OpenCPN uses wxWidgets, currently version 3.0.2 on Linux packages,
and 3.1.2 for other platforms. See
https://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/[wxWidgets Reference Manuals]

wxWidgets uses a tick-tock release schedule where even-numbered versions
are stable including a stable ABI. Odd-numbered version are unstable,
development versions.

On Linux platforms OpenCPN normally uses the current stable version,
at the time of writing 3.0. This is partly a practical issue since
conservative distributions like Debian don't package unstable, odd
versions.

One other platforms unstable, odd versions are occasionally used. At
the time of writing pre-built 3.1.2 binaries for MacOS and Windows are
distributed and used by OpenCPN builds.

Changing wxWidgets version leads to a ABI break for plugins, which
must be re-compiled against the new version.
