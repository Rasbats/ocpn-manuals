the publication of plugins on the main OpenCPN website. He is able to
make installers for the different operating systems and update that

The website entry for your plugin will contain a link to the sourcecode.
By users registering with GitHub (for example) issues can be raised with
the plugin author and comments made.

If a large number of changes have been made after publication consider
requesting another entry in
