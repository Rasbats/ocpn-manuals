= Internationalization (i18n)

[[i18n-overview]]

== Summary

**Maintainers basic message: we need a heads-up from plugin developer
when there is a need for translations. If we just get this, we are
able to assist in the complete process.**

The process:

. Plugin developer determines when to advise maintainers when there are
going to be no more new strings so that a *.POT file can be developed.
. Maintainers develop the [plugin].pot file and post it to Crowdin
announcing a deadline by which language updates must be ready.
. Maintainers make a Pull Request to the plugin developer with the
completed language *.PO files.
. Plugin developer merges the Pull Request which makes the languages
available when the plugin is built the next time.

== The i18n maintainers

The i18n workflows are maintained by a group which has the
necessary skills and Crowdin privileges. Currently this is
Pavel (@nohal), Hakan (@hakansv) and Dave (@bdbcat).

The maintainers supports plugin developers in all stages
from creating the pot-file to adding the translated
po-files to the project

== Overview

The OpenCPN plugins shares the i18n infrastructure with the main
opencpn program. In particular, plugins are subprojects in the
main opencpn project at https://crowdin.net/[Crowdin].

The workflow is based on the gettext tools and the
https://crowdin.net/project/opencpn[Crowdin] translation web service.
In the end this converts all strings like `_(some string)` to translated
content in runtime, content which is taken from machine-dependent,
binary mo-files.

The workflow: image:i18n.png[]

* The source files' translatable strings are marked using the
  `_()`macro.
* Using the xgettext tool, the translatable strings are extracted
  to a pot file.
* The pot file is sent to the i18n maintainers who submits it to
  the crowdin web translation service. Here, each plugin is a sub-project
  under the opencpn project.
* Translators translates the pot file to all sorts of languages using
  the https://crowdin.net/project/opencpn[Crowdin] web service, as
  exemplified https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor[here].
* A note in the
  http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/opencpn-internationalization-i18n-34181.html[i18n thread]
  from translator when she is completed is appreciated.
* The maintainers downloads the translated po files to and makes
  a PR against the plugin
* The plugin developer merges the PR which updates the po translations.
* During the build process, each po-file is compiled to a mo-file.
  These are the files used in runtime to provide translations.


== Notes
"Items" and "Texts" rule::
1 Item in the language file 1 = Display text.
Of course, this requires you to put more items in this file, but this is
the only way for each translator to take account of the peculiarities of
its language.
+
Currently, all the other plugins and the heart of OpenCPN follow this
rule and we can always translate very correctly. +

Translation priority between core and plugin::
_I have a question about translation priority between core and plugins,
....How can this be dealt with?_
+
It depends. Many plugins loads translations from both core  and
and the plugin. This is the scenario when no specific steps are taken
to avoid it. In this case, if both the plugin and main OpenCPN translates
the same item, the main program wins and the plugin translation is unused.
+
The upside is that the plugin can re-use common translations from the
main program.
+
To avoid translation conflicts, plugin developers must ensure that the
items they use are different from those of the core.  It is not necessary
that the difference is big, one different character is enough.
+
Plugins can be configured to just use translations from the plugin,
avoiding the overlap with the main program. See the
xref:plugin-workflows.adoc[plugin templates] page.
