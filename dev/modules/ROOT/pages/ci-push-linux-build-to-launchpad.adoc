= CI: Push Linux Build to Launchpad

== Initiate the push with 'git push origin [tag]'

In .travis it is possible to initiate the push of a Linux build to your
Launchpad repository. These instructions assume that you have a travis
account and know your way around the services and basic process. Your
travis account is used to confirm 'successful' builds of linux and osx,
and to create Linux packages to deploy to your Launchpad.

== How to push a .Travis 'built' file to your Launchpad

For travis refer to
http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/tactics-plugin-166909-2.html#post2913910[Petri's
post #637]

=== A. Configure the Travis file for security and permissions

. You can use this OCPN_Draw_pi
https://github.com/jongough/ocpn_draw_pi/blob/master/.travis.yml[.travis]
file as an example. The important part is the "- provider: launchpad"
section.

=== B. Launchpad provider at bottom of travis.yml file

Example Bottom section of the travis.yml file. Note: indentation is
important in yml files, child parts MUST be indeted below the owner.
This is shown below by "oauth_token:" being the owner and "secure:"
being the child, notice that "secure:" is indented.

....
deploy:
  - provider: launchpad
    slug: "Your repository slug here"
    oauth_token:
      secure: "Your encrypted oauth_token here" 
    oauth_token_secret: 
      secure: "Your encrypted oauth_token_secret here"
    skip_cleanup: true
    on: # Set Deploy conditions
      # Deploy only when tag is not specified
      # tags: false
      # or this branch
      #branches:
      #   only:
      #     - master
      tags: true
      all_branches: true
      condition: "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME = linux"
....

The "slug:" and "secure:" data items are in double quotes ("").

If you want another deploy section, like git, you will need to create a
new "- provider:" with the text "releases" following it. Both "-
provider:" labels need to have the same indentation.

=== C. Install Travis CLI to encrypt a Launchpad secure public key

. You need a travis CLI (command line interface) to be able to encrypt
the Launchpad tokens. The encrypted strings are put in your personal
.travis.yml file.
. Travis CLI installation instructions for Windows. When you are sure
that you have travis CLI up and working, you can start to create the
encrypted key. Without it, deployment to GitHub does not work.
. Travis CLI installation instructions for Linux. Windows10 users can
create a
https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:supplementary_software:run-ubuntu-in-win10[WSL-Windows
Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu 18.04LTS) on Win10 Installation], and then
from the linux command prompt
execute:`+sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
sudo apt-get install ruby
sudo apt-get install gem
ruby -v
gem install travis -v 1.8.10 --no-rdoc --no-ri
travis version
response: 1.8.10.

225mb disk space used.
+`

=== D. Install "curl" to allow posting information to Launchpad

Part of the process requires the http "Post" process to acquire security
tokens. The easy way to do this from a command prompt using the "curl"
program. * For Linux: Your package manager should be able to install
"curl" as it is a standard internet tool. * For Windows: goto this
website http://techieroop.com/how-to-install-curl-on-windows-10/ and
select the correct version for your setup.

=== E. Create a Launchpad "request-token"

Issue the following command from a command prompt.

....
curl --dump-header - -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST --data 'oauth_consumer_key=Travis+Deploy&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT&oauth_signature=%26' https://launchpad.net/+request-token
....

You should receive a reply like:

....
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok

Server: zope.server.http (HTTP)
X-Powered-By: Zope (www.zope.org), Python (www.python.org)

oauth_token=XJwTXv9f8RRRT6TwCZ4x&oauth_token_secret=lbrXHsQ0jVlJlqLpNX4mGWtNjcRp2rWzqhQx53KDhTM87m7f7MMGTNw7DsG3CcbhSbn3jwTCmMkFbFCG
....

Save this information as you will need it in following steps.

=== F. Authenticate the User

You will now need to logon to your Launchpad account. You need to have
been authenticated before you can issue the next command from your
browser. Open a new browser tab and enter the following in the "Address
line":

....
https://launchpad.net/+authorize-token?oauth_token={your oauth_token from step D:}
....

Your version could look like:

....
https://launchpad.net/+authorize-token?oauth_token=XJwTXv9f8RRRT6TwCZ4x
....

You will now be asked for the level of access to provide this token. The
easiest is to select "All", the last button on the page.

=== G. Get new secure Launchpad token

In your command prompt window issue the following command:

....
curl --dump-header - -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST --data 'oauth_signature=%26{your oauth_token_secret}&oauth_consumer_key=Travis+Deploy&oauth_token={your oauth_token}&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT' https://launchpad.net/+access-token
....

Your version would look like"

....
curl --dump-header - -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST --data 'oauth_signature=%26lbrXHsQ0jVlJlqLpNX4mGWtNjcRp2rWzqhQx53KDhTM87m7f7MMGTNw7DsG3CcbhSbn3jwTCmMkFbFCG&oauth_consumer_key=Travis+Deploy&oauth_token=XJwTXv9f8RRRT6TwCZ4x&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT' https://launchpad.net/+access-token
....

From this you would get a response like:

....
oauth_token=DJZmQkJ65F3M0HD4Lws5&oauth_token_secret=WbwMzlDhW3HpkHxLh7wrtkXqPZkFS8n6HHXrZXLj4WK0vKljjJqHtdx9hWmCLXJLZ0CQSc5kD8jWnsdn&lp.context=None
....

=== G. Encrypt your tokens before use

You should now encrypt your tokens before they are used. This makes the
interaction more secure.

* Change directory to your local code base for git.
* Issue command:

....
travis encrypt {your oauth_token from step F.> --org
....

* This may look like:

....
travis encrypt DJZmQkJ65F3M0HD4Lws5 --org
....

* You will receive a response like:

....
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:

  secure: "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"

Pro Tip: You can add it automatically by running with --add.
....

* PS. Don't do as suggested with the --add as it may destroy your
indentation in your .travis.yml file. It is far better to select the
line starting with "secure:" and copy paste it into the requisite
position in the .travis.yml file, in this case under "oauth_token"

* Issue command:

....
travis encrypt {your oauth_security_token from step F.> --org
....

* This may look like:

....

=== H. Start building the .travis project

. You will need to turn the project "on" after signing into your travis
account. Click on the icon in the top right with the down chevron and
select 'Settings', the page will display your respitories under the
'Repositories' tab. Make sure the ones you want to use have the slider
button to the right with a tick in the button. If it is to the left and
shows a cross it is not active.
. Then when you commit .travis.yml file, the travis build will start. It
is good to check that both of its build processes do pass faultlessly
before the next step.
. It takes awhile for each commit (Linux and Mac) to build correctly, be
patient when it is running.
. Make sure it built successfully. The project will not be saved because
travis does not provide that type of storage space.

=== I. Troubleshooting

When the Travis build does not work the error messages can be obscure
and not really help too much. A typical message may be:

Skipping a deployment with the provider because this branch is not
permitted:

This is not very helpful as it just says something went wrong not what.

. Check your whole .travis.yml file. Look at it carefully and compare it
to the example given.
. Make sure you have the security token enclosed in double quotes, i.e.
"security/token"
. Make sure the build process has actually worked for the file types you
are trying to transfer to github
. If you have extra values in your yml file make sure you really know
what they do. If you have issues, take all the extranous values out and
see if it works then.
. If necessary find a very small project and play with that as it will
compile much quicker.
. Make all changes in a branch of the main repository as you will have
to do multiple commits to get it working. Once it is working you can
make the changes to your main branch(es) and clean up the 'test' branch
