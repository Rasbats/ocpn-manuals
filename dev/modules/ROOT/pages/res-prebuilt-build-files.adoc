= Prebuilt  Build Files

The project publishes some prebuilt resources which are used
when building both the OpenCPN core and in plugin builds.

The links to these pre-built build dependencies can become
broken/changed occasionally (such as after CDN closed their sponsorship
program). When they do, please update this list.
