== AutoPilot Route

=== Aim

Provide Configurable Autopilot Route following abilities for OpenCPN.

The autopilot route plugin (beta) is a completely separate plugin to be
used with any autopilot. It allows you to use different algorithms and
closely tune them for route following logic. It has nothing specific to
pypilot. This plugin allows the user to select different algorithms and
closely tune them for route following logic. The autopilot route plugin
replaces the nmea APB output built into opencpn with many more options
for computing how this sentence is generated. It does output a
continuously changing bearing in some modes which is no problem for
pypilot, but some autopilots might not allow it.

The autopilot route plugin is capable of steering under sail in harbors.
This plugin is used in Sean's video of a heavy steel sailboat with a
windshield wiper motor driving the wheel and Autopilot_Route_pi
directing the motor: https://youtu.be/KQuBwLSMSxI

Modes:

. Route Position Bearing
. Standard Cross Track XTE -XTE multiplier
. Waypoint Bearing -by Distance or by Time

Options

. Confirm Bearing change on Waypoint Arrival.
. Intercept Route on Current Course

It has several other very nice features.

Interface Note

Keep in mind that this plugin does not have a normal toolbox icon or
menu, it's settings are controlled from the preferences menu.

=== Douwe Fokkema advises:

* There is a proprietary PGN that allows setting the heading of the
Raymarine EV-1 pilot when it is in auto mode. This is PGN 126208 with a
data length of 14. In canboat format this pgn looks as follows:

[source,code]
----
Z,3,126208,7,204,14,01,50,ff,00,f8,03,01,3b,07,03, 04,06,f0,3d
----

* The last 2 data bytes indicate the heading to be set in thousands of
radials, least significant first (divide by 174.53 to get degrees). So
the above will set a heading of 91 degrees.
* This is tested with canboat and a Actisense NGT-1 and functions
flawless.

=== Sean Advises:

The autopilot route plugin could easily be extended to emit this
message. I cannot really implement it because I have no way of testing
it.

==== Autopilot Connection from Windows via USB

NMEA is a serial connection using the RS422 physical layer. While the
'S' in 'USB' does stand for serial it is an entirely different serial
system. You will need a USB-serial converter for your laptop (unless
your laptop has an actual serial port, most newer ones do not). Done
properly you would get a USB-RS422 converter, but most systems will also
work with the more common USB-RS232 connector.

You will also need the driver for your operating system and the
converter you select, not all are created equal so make sure your flavor
of operating system is supported. After that the converter will appear
as a 'COM' port in Windows and you configure O to output to that COM
port.

There are lots of other options, including adding a WiFi dongle to your
Raymarine that means you don't have to use wires, but those get more
complicated.

=== FAQ

==== How to ‘pair’ Autopilot_Route _pi with Pypilot?

Pypilot works well itself. Autopilot_Route works itself and shows the
right overlay but does not direct pypilot in any gps or compass mode.

==== It looks like we have to find how to direct nmea output from autopilot to signalk. Could somebody share how one would use autopilot with pypilot or pypilot motor controller?

The Autopilot_Route Plugin is not specific to Pypilot or any other
autopilot. It replaces the nmea APB output built into opencpn with many
more options for computing how this sentence is generated. It does
output a continuously changing bearing in some modes which is no problem
for Pypilot, but some autopilots might not allow it.

. I didn't try other autopilots with the route plugin, but apparently
some autopilots require confirmation on bearing change. So the apb must
give the same bearing always and only after xte.
. The autopilot route plugin outputs a continuously changing bearing in
some modes always with xte of 0 (because xte is not used) so the
autopilot must accept this and not require confirmation for it to work.
. To make Pypilot follow routes from either Opencpn without the
autopilot route plugin or with it is the same. You need to make tcp
connection from Opencpn to Pypilot port 20220 with “output on this port”
checked.
. The latest version of the Pypilot Plugin can automatically send nmea
sentences to port 20220 on whatever host it connects to Pypilot for
Signalk which makes it easier to change the autopilot host (if you have
more than one, for example) without needing to add or change the
connection in opencpn.
