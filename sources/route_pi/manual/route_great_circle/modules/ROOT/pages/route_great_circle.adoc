=== Route Plugin

“Salty Paws” route plugin handles much more than Great circles,
introduced here.

The plugin has a few features not present in the built-in tool. It can
calculate a composite route, and the distance between the waypoints can
be set by the user. The end result, however, is a “gpx” file that is
exported, and then imported into OpenCPN via the Route Manager.
