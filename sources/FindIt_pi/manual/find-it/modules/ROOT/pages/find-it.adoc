=== 1. What and Why

This Plugin is a stowage manager.

The plugin can work alone or in conjunction with the LogbookKonni
plugin. If the LogbookKonni plugin is present and enabled and the Buy it
button is pressed the items in the Material or Provisions page marked
Buy will be transferred to the LogbookKonni page Maintenance/BuyParts.

=== 2. Install

See link:../install_and_enable.html[Install and Enable] page for
installing this plugin.

=== 3. Standard actions

First you have to define the Units, e.g. Bottle, Can, Tin, Box etc.

Then you have to create the possible locations in the boat. These
Locations are user definable and depend on the possible locations on
board. The locations below are just for demo purposes.

Now you can create Material or Provisions with the units and locations
defined previously.

If the *Actual* count will be below the *Quota*, the *Balance* will be
positive and the *Buy* indicator will be set to *Yes*. Clicking on the
*Buy it* button will transfer the *Yes* marked lines to the
*LogbookKonni* plugin in the *Maintenance/BuyParts* section. Depending
on the *Priority* it will be marked in different colors.
