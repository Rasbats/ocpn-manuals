==== Aim

To simplify the prediction of tidal heights for dates many days in the
future (past).

Normally many tide stations are shown on the chart when this option is
selected.

TideFinder selects the four closest tidal stations within a range of
100nm.

One of these can be selected and prediction data displayed in a similar
way to the base program.

==== Requirements

[source,code]
----
OpenCPN 5.2.4 and above.
----

=== 1. What and Why

The tidal prediction available from the core OpenCPN program is good for
the current date/time and a few days into the future. This plugin uses a
calendar to allow predictions for a date/time many days into the future
(or the past). It also limits the number of ports to those closest to
the location of the boat.

=== 2. Install

The plugin is available in the Beta catalog of the plugin manager. After
installation the TideFinder plugin is added to the list and can be
enabled.
