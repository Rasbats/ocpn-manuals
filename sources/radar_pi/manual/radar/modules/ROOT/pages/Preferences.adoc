== Preferences dialog
You can change various preferences for the plugin.

The preferences dialog can be reached via _OpenCPN Options > Plugins >
Radar > Preferences_ or via the PPI menu _Advanced > Preferences_.

It looks like this:

image::preferences.png[Preferences]

== Range units

You can choose Nautical Miles, Mixed or Kilometers. Not all radars
support all types, in which case this setting will not change the
reported settings.

== GPU drawing method

You can choose between two types of drawing the picture; Vertex Array
and Shader. Depending on the hardware and OS it is possible that one
performs better than the other. Shader will perform the same regardless
of how "busy" the radar picture is, whereas Vertex Array will use more
CPU when there is more to draw. Also, Shader draws a little more
"soft" image on most devices.

== Control Menu Auto Hide

If you have a small display, or just prefer it that way, you can make
the _Control Menu_ dialog disappear automatically if you are not using
it. You then need to access it by pressing the _Menu_ area on the PPI
window or via the _Context_ menu (right mouse button.)

== Guard zone styling

Depending on the colors and transparency it can be hard to see where the
guard zones are. Change the styling of the guard zones to fix this.

== Guard zone sound

If you don’t like the woman’s voice announcing a guard zone, you can
change the alert sound, as well as the repetition time of such alarms
when they are not confirmed.

== Colors

You can change the color palette for Target trails, Targets, and the
Radar PPI window background and AIS targets.

== Options

You can choose whether to:

* _Ignore radar heading_ passed in via RI10/11 (Navico Broadband only) 
* _Pass RI10/11 radar heading to OpenCPN_ (Navico Broadband only) 
* _Enable COG as heading_, allows overlay when you do not have a compass heading input. 
* _Reverse the mouse wheel zoom direction_

You can choose the following display options: 

* _Show ring at extreme range_, allows you to see the exact maximum range that the radar is
producing 
* _Show guard zones on overlay_ 
* _Show target trails on overlay_
* _Show data on overlay when radar is standby._ (Such as guard zones)

And lastly, you can re-select your radar types.
