== Radar operations

== The toolbar button
.The toolbar button shows the state of the radar:
* Radar not detected image:radar_notdetected_n.png[] 
* Radar standby  image:radar_standby_n.png[] 
* Radar transmitting  image:radar_transmit_n.png[] 
* Radar windows hidden image:radar_hidden_n.png[] 

.The action taken when clicking the icon depends on the current state:
* When radar overlay is enabled but the control menu is not shown it
shows the control menu.
* Otherwise it toggles the radar windows and overlay off (hidden) or on
(shown).

Hiding all radar windows and overlay is useful if you are sailing into a
highly complex situation where you want full view of the chart display
and not have the distraction of radar windows and paints over your
charts. The radar keeps its current settings (it keeps transmitting if
this was on) until you un-hide (show) it again.

== The OpenCPN context menu
There are also entries in the _context menu_ for the radar plugin. The
context menu is usually accessed by clicking the right mouse button on
the chart window. 

image::radar_context_menu_1.png[]

.These are:
* Hide radar
* Show radar
* Radar control…

Hide or Show radar should be self-explanatory. If chart overlay is
enabled the _Radar control…_ button will show the control menu for that
radar only. If chart overlay is disabled it will show the control
menu(s) for one or two radars.

== The PPI window(s)

Up to four classic radar displays, known as Position Plot Indicators
(PPI) by professionals, can be shown. You can hide these if so desired
(which makes sense only if you enabled the overlay over the chart). You
can resize, move or dock them into the chart display. To close them you
use the default OS button on the top of the window. To dock or undock
them, open the radar control menu and select _Windows > Float/Dock
PPI_ .

The author likes to use two radar ranges with the windows docked on the
right side of the display, one above the other. But just try it out to
see what you like best.

The PPI window has a _Menu_ button that accesses the control menu. If
you moved the PPI window since the last time you accessed the control
menu the menu will come up immediately above the Menu button on the PPI
window.

== The control menu

Every radar has its own _control menu_. If radar overlay is enabled and
you have hidden the control menu of the radar assigned to radar overlay,
press the toolbar icon to access the control menu. If all else fails you
can access this using the context menu on the chart display (_Right
mouse button > Radar control …_)

The control menu only shows those options which are functional for the
particular state of the radar, and has various sub-menus.

=== The main menu

When the radar is not transmitting the menu looks like this:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Button |Possible values |Purpose
|Adjust | |Change basic settings such as range, gain, clutter
|Advanced | |Change advanced settings
|View | |Picture orientation and trails
|Cursor | |Information and settings driven by the cursor
|Guard zones | |Controlling the guard zones
|Window | |How the PPI or overlay is displayed
|Timed transmit | |Schedule radar transmission
|Start/Stop radar |Standby, Transmitting, Timed state |Toggle radar transmit state
|===

_Note:_ Your radar may not support all shown items, in which case they
are not shown in the menu.

_Note:_ Unlike earlier releases, all menu items that your radar supports
are always shown. If they cannot be enabled they are shown greyed out.

== Adjust menu

image::radar_menu_adjust.png[Adjust menu]

This allows you to set radar gain, sea clutter, rain clutter and range.
Range can be set to Auto if the radar picture is overlayed on the chart.
Depending on your radar type several auto modes are possible for sea
clutter.

== Advanced menu

image::radar_menu_advanced.png[Advanced menu]

The advanced settings allows other settings to be modified. These are
radar specific. You can also go even deeper to the _Installation_ menu,
which allows modification of radar settings such as the heading
correction and mount height.

== View menu

image::radar_menu_view.png[View menu]

The view menu allows modification of how the radar picture is viewed.
You can set the orientation and center of the radar picture in the PPI
window. You can also change the refresh rate; if you want a continuously
sweeping update increase the refresh rate. If your computer cannot keep
up with the radar picture (high CPU or GPU load) or you are using a
remote viewer such as VNC you can lower the refresh rate.

The target trails options will make radar targets linger on the screen,
shown in a white-grey palette. Target trails are especially useful if
your radar is having trouble with reliable target detection. It can also
be used as a poor-mans doppler effect: if the radar heading
stabilization would be perfect, only moving targets will show a large
trail.
You can switch between _true_ and _relative_ trails. The latter shows the 
target's motion relative your own course and speed.

You can also modify whether AIS and ARPA triangles are shown on the PPI
windows.

Lastly, for HALO radars that support it we can enable the Doppler mode
built into these radars; with Doppler the radar will show clearly (in
yellow) which targets are moving more than 3 knots towards or away from
the radar.

== Cursor menu

image::radar_menu_cursor.png[Cursor menu]

The PPI windows will always show where the cursor on the main chart
window is in blue, and if you click on the chart or PPI window this
position will be marked with a white cursor.

The cursor menu will allow you to use this white cursor mark. You can
either use it as an EBL/VRM mark, which shows an Electronic Bearing Line
(EBL) with a range ring (Virtual Range Mark). The EBL/VRM can be used as
a "memory" so that you can compare the current position of a target
with an earlier position and range.

The other use is that you can have the radar acquire a target that is at
or near the cursor location. This is called MARPA - Mini Automatic Radar
Plotting Aid. If the MARPA target is seen another 2 revolutions of the
scanner it will be converted into an AIS-like target that is shown both
on the PPI window (if enabled on the View menu) and the chart displays.
The plugin supports 50 (M)ARPA targets. See Guard Zones below for ARPA.

== Guard zones menu

image::radar_menu_guard_zones.png[Guard zones menu]

You can define two _guard zones_ where, if targets are seen in that
sector of the radar, they will either sound an alarm and/or be converted
into an ARPA target.

Which option you prefer is dependent on what sort of environment you are
sailing in; in congested waters it may be advantageous to use the ARPA
facility for a guard zone that extends ahead of the boat. This way boats
without an AIS will automatically be converted over to ARPA targets.

If you choose to have the guard zones raise an alarm you will see an
alarm dialog box and a voice over saying ``Alarm: Targets detected''. If
you _confirm_ the alarm it will not be raised until the targets have
disappeared from the guard zone and re-appear.

== Window menu

image::radar_menu_window.png[Window menu]

Via the _window_ menu you can choose whether the PPI window is shown and
whether the radar picture should be _overlayed_ over the chart window.
For the latter to be enabled you need GNSS position and heading (or COG,
see _Preferences_.)

You can also _dock_ the PPI window. This means that the PPI window is
not shown as a separate window, but shown on the right side of the
chart(s) on the main OpenCPN window.

You can also access the _Info_ window which will show automatically if
something is wrong or a setting is insufficient. This allows you to
check the detected radar type(s) and how many radar spokes are received.

== Timed transmit

image::radar_menu_timed_transmit.png[Timed transmit menu]

Timed transmit is useful for magnetron radars that (a) use a lot of
power and (b) have a limited life span. For modern non-magnetron digital
radars this is not really useful.

It allows you to set both the _on_ time and the _standby_ time of
the radar. When activated the status will be shown at the _Control menu > Start/Stopp_ button.
