== Garmin hardware installation.
The Garmin HD and xHD radars are very easy to use with OpenCPN. All you
need is a wired Ethernet connection.

You can add as many computers as desired, the system will allow
operation from all connected MFDs (plotters) and computers.

_Note:_ Unlike the older _GRadar_ plugin, the new common plugin does not
distinguish between _slave_ and _master_ mode. You can always control
the radar from both an (optional) chartplotter and the OpenCPN
computer(s).

== Shared setup with a Garmin MFD

If you already have a Garmin MFD installed the installation consists of:

* Installing an Ethernet switch, or a WiFi router with a built in
Ethernet switch. You need a wired port for each device – the radar, the
MFD(s) and the computer running OpenCPN.
* Connect all devices to the switch.

You cannot connect the computer to the auxiliary ethernet ports on the
scanner, and possibly also not if the chartplotter has multiple Ethernet
ports – the latter is untested.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* If you do not use a Garmin Ethernet switch, you will
need to bypass pin 5 on all ethernet ports connected to a Garmin device.
The Garmin devices use pin 5 as a _power up_ signal when it is shorted
to ground (the shield of the ethernet cable.)

A typical installation with a generic switch would look like this:

== Installation with only a scanner

When there is no Garmin chartplotter involved, you can make a direct
connection between the computer and the scanner, but in this case it is
imperative that you make pin 5 switchable to power up the scanner. An
example configuration could look like this:

== Suggested hardware for power control

A convenient method to access the Ethernet radar scanner power control
pin (Pin5) is to use a Female-­Female Ethernet adapter plug. A readily
available commercial adapter is recommended, such as the Amphenol
MRJ­5780­01 adapter. This particular component contains a small PC board
which allows easy access to the individual Ethernet cable pins for
bypass jumper and switch attachment.

== Network interface

The Garmin radars and chartplotters all use automatic or static IP
addresses (without a DHCP server) in the range 172.16.1.0 with netmask
255.255.240.0. The plugin will not work, and actively complain, if it
cannot find an ethernet card with an address in this range.

=== Dedicated ethernet port

The recommended way to use the radar is to use a dedicated ethernet port
that is assigned the following data:

....
IP address: 172.16.1.1
Netmask:    255.255.240.0
....

It does not need a router or DNS address.

=== Shared ethernet port

If you share the ethernet port that you use for the radar with other
uses, for instance to connect to a router that connects you to the
internet, this is still possible but is a little more complex. This
involves adding an _alias port_, which allows a single physical ethernet
card to have multiple IP addresses.

==== Linux

With Linux, you can do this as follows:

....
$ sudo ifconfig eth1:1 172.16.1.1 netmask 255.255.240.0 up
....

where `eth1` will vary with your hardware.

If you want to set this permanently, this is possible as well. Check
your OS manual for more details, but if your OS supports the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file you can add the following stanza:

....
auto eth1:1
iface eth1:1 inet static
    name Garmin special
    address 172.16.1.1
    netmask 255.255.240.0
....

This configuration system used to be almost ubiquitous, but recent Linux
versions may also use SystemD for networking in which case the setup is
different (and not explained here yet.)

==== Microsoft Windows

In Microsoft Windows, it is also possible to setup alias IP addresses.
For example, in Windows you may select _Network Adapter ­>
Properties­ > TCP/IP­/IPv4 > Properties­ > Advanced_. Here you may add an
additional IP address (aliases) as required. Use IP address
`172.16.1.1` with a netmask of `255.255.240.0`. Note that on Windows,
alias IP addresses may only be set if a static IP addresses are
enabled, and DHCP auto configuration is not used.
