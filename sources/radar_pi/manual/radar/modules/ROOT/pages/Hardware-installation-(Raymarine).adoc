The supported Raymarine radars are very easy to use with OpenCPN. All
you need is a wired Ethernet connection.

You can add as many computers as desired, the system will allow
operation from all connected MFDs (plotters) and computers.

== Shared setup with a Raymarine MFD

The radars supported by the plugin are the _old_ analog radars, not yet the digital and the Quantum
generation radars. See table. Most of these radomes connect via a thick cable directly
into a Radar display or an older MFD like the ``E Series Classic legacy
Display''.

These have a Seatalk _hs_ port, which is nothing else than Ethernet. The
seatalk _hs_ physical connection is a standard RJ45 jack with a
weatherproof collar.

Connect an Ethernet switch and link it to the Seatalk _hs_ port on your
display.
