=== Retrieve Charts Previously Purchased.

To retrieve the charts I purchased earlier NVcharts directed me to this
website:
http://eu.nvcharts.com/shop/index.php?page=content&coID=43[NV-Chart
Download]

There you can find the charts you purchased and you want to download by
year of release. +
I found the Windward Islands kit but couldn't find the Leeward Islands
kit.

Enter the charts you need to download and click on the download button.
The charts will be downloaded as an exe file. Run the exe file and enter
your serial numbers, name and email and then it will install the charts.
They recommend saving them in C:Chartkit/BSB. That's where I installed
and then pointed Opencpn to that subdirectory and everything works well.
