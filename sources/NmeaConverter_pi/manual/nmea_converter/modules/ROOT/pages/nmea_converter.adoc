NMEAconverter is a utility that can parse incoming NMEA sentences/data,
adjust and/or make calculations with the data, and then output a new
NMEA sentence to have that adjusted data appear in OpenCPN. Examples
include calculating true wind speed/angle from apparent wind data and
boat speed information, changing units (degrees C to F or vice-versa,
knots to km, etc.), or correcting malformed sentences created by some
equipment where the sentence would otherwise be ignored by OpenCPN or
displayed improperly.

Please note that there is no Toolbar Icon. NmeaConverter works from the
Preferences button of the plug-in. Options|Plug-ins|NMEAConvertor –>
Preferences

To use the plugin a basic understanding of NMEA sentences is required.
Please see the link:../../advanced_features/nmea_sentences.html[NMEA
Sentences Page] for details on NMEA sentences and the fields each
sentence contains. The basics of an NMEA sentence are:

* Initial delimiter (usually $, sometimes !)
* Talker ID (the instrument sending the data, two characters, optional)
* Sentence name - three characters
* Data, in fields, comma separated
* End delimiter - *
* Checksum
* Carriage Return+Linefeed

Example $GPRMB,field1,field2,…field15*<0xChecksum><0x0D><0x0A>

----

The basic format of a conversion command is:

[source,code]
----
NewSentence, Argument for Field 1, Argument for Field 2, ...Argument for field n
----

NewSentence = $IDYYY where ID is a talker ID you would like to use to
denote sentences from the converter. The examples in this manual
generally use XX as the talker ID for newly created sentences. YYY is
the NMEA sentence identifier you would like to send. A simple conversion
example - this sample takes the 5th and 6th fields of an MDA sentence
and transmits a new MTA sentence:

[source,code]
----
$XXMTA, $WIMDA5, $WIMDA6
----

Arguments can take the form of constants (numeric or text), values from
an incoming NMEA sentence, or calculations using either or both
constants and incoming data. In the simplest form an argument is an
incoming NMEA sentence and field number - $GPRMC4 will get the fourth
value in any RMC sentence received by OpenCPN from talker GP. Use the
link:../../advanced_features/nmea_sentences.html[NMEA Sentences Page] to
figure out what sentence you want to send, what data fields are
required, and how the fields are configured. You must build a complete
version of the sentence you want to send, and put the right data/fields
from the original source in the right places for the converter to work
properly. A number of detailed examples are provided below for
reference.

When inserting argument fields the wildcard “?” can be used to tell the
converter to use data with any content where the “?” appears. The
wildcard “??” at the front of an argument will tell the converter to use
data from any talker sending the requested sentence (e.g. $??HDG3 will
retrieve the third field from any HDG sentence regardless of sender). Be
careful when using wildcards and the talker ID, especially when
correcting malformed sentences. If you create a conversion that outputs
the same sentence as any field used in the input (e.g. $XXHDG,
$??HDG3,…..) you will create a loop that will crash the plugin (and
OpenCPN). Every time the plugin evaluates it will see its own creation,
because of the wildcard it will reevaluate, …

Once a conversion is defined you can select whether to send the
calculated sentence on a fixed timing (every x seconds) or only when the
incoming data is updated.

You do not need to add the end delimiter (*) or the checksum in your
converter definitions - the converter will calculate the checksum and
add the delimiter and checksum automatically.

Depending on the data you are manipulating you may want to go into the
link:../../options_setting/connections.html[OpenCPN Connections Tab] and
tell OpenCPN to ignore the original data. If you are making unit
conversions, for instance, and do not ignore the original data you will
end up with a display that flashes between the original value and the
converted value. Setting the data to ignore will not affect the
converter, the data will still be received there, it simply prevents the
display of the data in OpenCPN.

For Reference from the
link:../../advanced_features/nmea_sentences.html[NMEA Sentences Page],
sentences that can be displayed in OpenCPN include:

* DBT - Depth Below Transducer
* DPT - Depth of Water
* GGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data
* GLL - Geographic Position - Latitude/Longitude HDG Heading - Deviation
& Variation
* HDM - Heading - Magnetic
* HDT - Heading - True
* MTA - Air Temperature (obsolete)
* MDA - Meteorological Composite (obsolete) Use XDR transducer instead.
* MTW - Mean Temperature of Water
* VLW - Distance Traveled through Water
* MWD - Wind Direction & Speed
* MWV - Wind Speed and Angle
* RMC - Recommended Minimum Navigation Information
* RSA - Rudder Sensor Angle
* VHW - Water speed and heading
* VTG - Track made good and Ground speed
* VWR - Relative Wind Speed and Angle
* VWT - True Windspeed and Angle (obsolete)
* XDR - Transducer Values
* ZDA -Time & Date - UTC, day, month, year and local time zone
* AIVDO - Automatic Information System (AIS) position reports from own
vessel

=== 1. Getting Started

Install the plugin in accordance with the
link:../install_and_enable.html[Plugin Installation Instructions].

Then open the Preferences Dialog to set up your conversions.

image::nmea-converter.png[]

If you see something like above please enlarge the nmeaSendObjectDlg
window so it displays the “OK” and “Cancel” buttons.

=== 2. First Test

image::testmessage1.png[]

This is a completely useless sentence that is sent every second to
OpenCPN. Check also the NMEAdebug window in the picture above, and note
that a checksum is added to the sentence. It is easy to change this one
into something like:

[source,code]
----
$GPRMC,085437,A,5324.3052,N,00611.5704,E,3.3,68.9,070614,0.3,E,A
----

Just enter this line into the NMEAConverter > Preference > New > Edit
box and Save it. No VDR file is needed. That will fake a GPS position
into OpenCPN, but still not very useful.

=== 3. Use incoming data to send a different NMEA sentence

The real power of this plugin is that you can change the data of the
sent sentence by cherry picking from incoming sentences. The reason I
wrote this plugin was I wanted Dashboard to show the air temperature. To
get the data, Dashboard needs an $xxMTA sentence, however I had a Airmar
PB200 unit that is sending $xxMDA sentences.

An example: We have from the windset,

MDA- Meteorological (Obsolete)

[source,code]
----
$WIMDA,30.1,I,1.0,B,11.3,C,,,,,,,18.6,T,18.5,M,5.8,N,3.0,M*27
----

and want: MDA- Air temperature

[source,code]
----
$xxMTA,11.3,C*<Checksum>
----

Note that the data needed is in fields 5 and 6 of the MDA sentence.
(11.3 degrees Celsius)

Setting the format to

[source,code]
----
$XXMTA, $WIMDA5, $WIMDA6
----

will give an output sentence:

[source,code]
----
$XXMTA, 11.3, C*26
----

Where *$WIMDA5* is replaced by the 5th field of the $WIMDA sentence.
etc.

image::xxmtamessage2.png[]

As seen above, the $XXMTA sentence is sent each time a $WIMDA sentence
is received and read by Dashboard.

For testing use VDR_pi or VDRplayer and run

link:../../../files/nmea/wimda_ocmda.zip[WIMDA+OCMDA.txt from this zip]

=== 4. Do Math - Convert Units, e.g. Centigrade to Fahrenheit

But what if I was living in the US and preferred the reading to be in
degrees Fahrenheit? Just change the format to:

[source,code]
----
$XXMTA, 9/5*$WIMDA5 + 32, F
----

image::xxmtamessage3.png[image::xxmtamessage3.png[image,width=641,height=366]]

The value is recalculated and displayed as degrees Fahrenheit.

Use the same file for testing use VDR_pi or VDRplayer and run
link:../../../files/nmea/wimda_ocmda.zip[WIMDA+OCMDA.txt from this zip]

=== 5. Force True Heading to COG

In NMEAconverter create a HDG (compass) sentence from your COG. Possible
use when the autopilot is old and does not receive heading (true or
magnetic).

Note: Since computation of the drift and surface current requires HDG,
it is understood that while using Tactics_pi value for Current speed and
direction will not be useful. All you will see is the speed difference
between SOG and STW, which would force Current to be the vector
component normal to the keel. That means the “current” display will
always be directly from bow or stern, in other words the component of
the current along the centerline of the boat, assuming your STW(speed
through water) is calibrated correctly.

See
http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/tactics-plugin-166909-36.html#post2140937[CF
Tactics_pi Post #22].

image::aufnahme37.jpeg[]

The NMEA file being run by VDR_pi is

link:../../../files/nmea/vdr2_-_copie.xls[vdr2 - copie.xls]

Tactics_pi and in particular, NMEAconverter_pi is using

[source,code]
----
$XXHDT,$IIVTG1,$IIVTG2
----

Remember that setting HDT to COG will give you no drift angle at all
(except maybe a small portion via the manual heel input), so you will
not see any real current I suggest to set a fixed heel angle to 0 (see
screenshot above), to avoid side effects with manual heel input at very
low speeds and small speed differences between SOG and STW.

=== 6. Calculate True Wind from Apparent Wind

==== Known

Boat Speed ground (kts) = SOG +
Apparent wind speed (degrees) = AWS +
Apparent wind angle (degrees) = AWA

==== MWV - Wind Speed and Angle - Input

[source,code]

. Reference, R = Relative, T = True
. Wind Speed
. Wind Speed Units, K/M/N
. Status, A = Data Valid
. Checksum

==== RMA - Recommended Minimum Navigation Information - Input

[source,code]
----
$–RMA,A,llll.ll,a,yyyyy.yy,a,x.x,x.x,x.x,x.x,x.x,a*hh<CR><LF>

NMEA 0183 from http://www.catb.org/gpsd/NMEA.html

==== Calculations Needed:

x =AWS*sin(AWA*3.14159265/180) +
y =(x/tan(AWA*3.14159265/180)) - SOG +
TWS (True Wind Speed) =x/sin(TWA*3.14159265/180) +
TWA (True Wind Angle) =atan(x/y)*180/3.14159265 +
*Formula from http://www.bethandevans.com/calculators.htm +

The formula now needs to be completed: +
*$XXMWV,*

==== TWS and TWA

----

. $s were missing in the previous version
. Changed wind speed unit from K to N
. Deleted spaces after commas.
. In terms of sog vs. stw, as pointed out, in most cases, diff is
negligible I believe.
. One thing about stw is that the sensor cannot capture the movement of
a vessel due to tide (as high as 5 knots!).
. For my purpose, gps is good enough.

==== Observations by Rhythm Doctor:

One needs to be careful with this calculation. There are at least two
different syntaxes for the reporting of relative wind angle. The older
VWR and VWT sentences for relative and true wind are not recommended for
new devices, but there are many older devices and SeaTalk converters
that still use them (specifically, my own instruments). The sentences
look like this (with II talker ID in this example):

[source,code]
----
$IIVWR,084.0,R,10.4,N,5.4,M,19.3,K
$IIVWT,084.0,R,10.4,N,5.4,M,19.3,K
----

_1 084.0 Wind Angle 0 - 180 +
2 R Right of vessel heading (L = Left) +
3 10.4 Wind Speed +
4 N Wind Speed units Knots +
5 5.4 Wind Speed +
6 M Wind Speed units Metres per second +
7 19.3 Wind Speed +
9 K Wind Speed units Km/Hr_

Newer devices use the preferred MWV sentence structure that looks like
this (with II talker ID in this case):

[source,code]
----
$IIMWV,084.0,R,10.4,N,A
$IIMWV,084.0,T,10.4,N,A
----

_1 084.0 Wind Angle 0 - 359 +
2 R Relative (T = True) +
3 10.4 Wind Speed +
4 N Wind Speed units Knots (K = KPH, M = MPH) +
5 A Status (A= Valid)_

Note that VWR/VWT and MWV work totally differently: VWR provides wind
angles from 0-180 with an additional parameter of L or R, while MWV
provides wind angles from 0-359 with no L or R. Converting your obsolete
VWR sentence to the more modern MWV sentence would seem to be impossible
without a conditional if() statement, which appears to not be supported
(since I was unable to get it to work).

Here is the sentence that works best for me for converting VWR
(relative/apparent wind) to VWT (true wind). Using the wildcard (instead
of II, GP, or WI sender IDs) allows testing with others' VWR sentences,
including Paul Elliot's test NMEA files:

[source,code]
----
$XXVWT,90-deg(atan(($??VWR3*cos(rad($??VWR1))-$??RMC7)/$??VWR3*sin(rad($??VWR1)))),$??VWR2,sqrt(sqr($??VWR3*sin(rad($??VWR1)))+sqr($??VWR3*cos(rad($??VWR1))-$??RMC7)),$??VWR4,,,,
----

Note that there is an invisible <return> character at the end of this
sentence (after the four commas). In my testing, things don't work right
without it. I recommend that you include it if you copy/paste this
formula into the config dialog.

==== Transmitter Dan advises:

It is possible to replace the sender ID (GP or WI) with ?? which means
any sender ID will be accepted. Using the wildcard will allow Paul
Elliot's test NMEA file to work with the NMEAconverter formula, using
Seatalk - vYacht dialect:

[source,code]
----
$XXMWV,90-deg(atan(($??MWV3*cos(rad($??MWV1))-$GPRMC7)/$??MWV3*sin(rad($??MWV1)))),T,sqrt(sqr($??MWV3*sin (rad($??MWV1)))+sqr($??MWV3*cos(rad($??MWV1))-$GPRMC7)),N,A
----

Edit: In above formula's 3.14159265 might be replaced by “pi”, and
3.14159265/180 can also be written as “deg”.

=== 7. Normalize Degrees to less than 360

==== For True Wind Direction (TWD) = Sum between True Wind Angle (MWV) and True Heading (HDT)

image::nmeaconverter-greater-than-360-crop.png[]

==== Math Basis

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628386/normalise-orientation-between-0-and-360[Normalize
orientation between 0 and 360]

Formula for re-orienting circular values i.e to keep angle between 0 and
359 is:

[source,code]
----
angle + Math.ceil( -angle / 360 ) * 360
----

Generalized formula for shifting angle orientation can be:

[source,code]
----
angle + Math.ceil( (-angle+shift) / 360 ) * 360
----

in which value of shift represent circular shift for e.g I want values
in -179 to 180 then it can be represented as:

[source,code]
----
angle + Math.ceil( (-angle-179) / 360 ) * 360
----

What is math.ceil? Java script function.

The
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil[Math.ceil()]
function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given
number. Note: Math.ceil(null) returns integer 0 and does not give a NaN
error.

NMEAConverter has this comparable function:

[source,code]
----
ceil : the smallest integer greater than or equal to x
----

Homebrew MOD function:

[source,code]
----
=( Angle /360-INT( Angle /360))*360
----

image::nemaconverter-normalize-degrees-crop.png.detail.html[]

==== Implementation

All data comes from Raymarine instrument with NMEA 0183. Here the two
data values to have in OpenCPN:

* True Heading
* True Wind Direction 0-359

[source,code]
----
$XXHDT,$??HDG1,T
$WIMWD,($??MWV1+$??HDT1)+ceil((-($??MWV1+$??HDT1))/360)*360,T,,M,$??MWV3,N,,M
----

Max reports that it works well. - Thank you Max.

The formula to normalize the degrees to be between 0-360 is

[source,code]
----
ceil((-($??MWV1+$??HDT1))/360)*360
----

=== 8. Prepare Barometer Sensor Output for Dashboard

==== Aim

The BMP180 pressure sensor output from Raspberry Pi/OpenPlotter uses the
sentence $OSXDR. This cannot be read by Dashboard. BMP180 Output Units
are Bars i.e 1000 times the reading needed for display -
mBar/hectoPascal. Any error in the output cannot be corrected. This
formula creates an $xxMDA (deprecated) or $xxXDR sentence that can be
used by Dashboard.

==== Conversion

[source,code]
----
$MYXDR,P, 0.018 + 1/1000 * $OSXDR2,B,Barometer
----

Deprecated:

[source,code]
----
$MYMDA, , ,0.018 +1/1000*$OSXDR2,,B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,M
----

(0.018 is an error correction and also adjusts the barometer pressure
for a sea level reading)

==== Applying the settings

Found it necessary to tick the 'block incoming messages with wrong
checksum' box when editing the sentence.

image::block_incomming.png[image:../../../dev/plugins/beta_plugins/plugins_under_development/block_incomming.png[image,width=400]]

When editing the sentence; starting a variable with '.' or '$' causes
OpenCPN to freeze. Variables are being read by the plugin all the time
and these characters are not recognized. Workaround is to type '0.' and
then the number. Also 'OSXDR2' and then add the '$' in front, '$OSXDR2'.

image::osxdr_variables.png[]

image::virtual_mda.png[]

=== 9. Fix incorrect ST60 Wind Speed Data

Ratsea has fixed an incorrect Raymarine ST60 conversion.

==== Problem

Dashboard displays incorrect wind speed data when using the ST60 Multi
NMEA Output. The data is treated as Km/hr as it has the K unit
identifier and is converted to knots/m per sec/Km/hr as per the
Dashboard settings, it then incorrect as the data is already in Knots

==== Aim

Change the display units in the wind output sentence from ST60 Multi
from K (kms/hr) to N (kts) as the Raymarine instrument incorrectly uses
the K identifier for Knots and not the N, so that the Dashboard
correctly displays the Wind Speed data in the units selected.

==== Process

Using the NMEA converter, apply the conversion to the MWV sentence with
a new ID - xx:

[source,code]
----
$xxMWV,$IIMWV1,$IIMWV2,$IIMWV3,N,$IIMWV5
----

and tick 'Send after update all variable' With the instrument switched
on and receiving the actual live data shows in Blue.

image::nmea-con-st60.jpeg[]

The NMEA datastream then becomes:

[source,code]
----
$IIHDM,143,M*3A
$IIMTW,025.2,C*26
$IIMWV,155,R,009.0,K,A*2E Input
$xxMWV,155,R,9.0,N,A*2B Corrected, the input line is also shown on the dashboard, but too quickly to notice
$IIVHW,,T,143,M,00.00,N,00.00,K*63
----

==== Caution

Whilst developing this code, I found that using the formula:

[source,code]
----
$IIMWV,$IIMWV1,$IIMWV2,$IIMWV3,N,$IIMWV5
----

would also work if the 'Send every (n) seconds' was ticked, but the
Dashboard would flash between the two values of Km/sec and knots. If the
Send after update all… was ticked, then OpenCPN would freeze in a
continuous loop trying to update the newly created NMEA sentence!

=== 10. Use Wildcards

Now it is possible to use wildcards in the identifiers. So you could
make it talkerid independent by using something similar to

[source,code]
----
.....$??XXX3....
----

and whatever character on the ? position will cause a hit.

Even more important, you might use it for special transducers sending
the something like

[source,code]
----
$OWXDR,H,....or $OWXDR,C....
----

sentence.

Note that field 1 is part of the identifier. As the comma is the NMEA
separator, you can not use it as an identifier string, but by using a
wildcard it works.

For example

[source,code]
----
 ....$OWXDR?H2... or $??XDR?H2....
----

will work.
https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/new-plugin-nmeaconvertor-145073.html#post3218765[Cruiser
Forum Post]

=== 10. Wildcards Example: Change Engine data format

Using wildcards is also useful when the data to be matched is in the
data payload rather than the header. In the example below, we have
engine data coming from the NMEA stream which contains the correct
sender transducer ID, however is not the format required by the Engine
Dashboard plug-in. Here is the original NMEA sentences:

{empty}[code] _Engine RPM $ERRPM,E,0,2324.00,,A*69_ Oil Pressure,
Coolant Temp, and Engine Hours
$ERXDR,P,4.04,B,ENGOILP0,C,75.25,C,ENGTEMP0,G,2024 .1,,ENGHRS0*01
_Battery0 (Starter) Voltage and Shunt Current
$ERXDR,U,13.75,V,BATVOLT0,I,0.8,A,BATCURR0*4D_ Battery1 (House) Voltage
$ERXDR,U,13.27,V,BATVOLT1*14 [/code]

You can see that the two battery voltages are distinguished using
different transducer IDs, BATVOLT0 and BATVOLT1

The following NMEA Converter plug-in code converts to sentences so that
the Engine Dashboard can read them. For the sentence that contains
multiple data elements, we can us the wildcard “$ERXDR?P2” to match on
the particular sentence that has the data we need.

To get battery voltage and current, we need to make liberal use of the
wildcard to match out to the “I” in order to distinguish from the
BATVOLT1 sentence. this gets us the battery0 voltage and the DC shunt
current.

For battery1, I have not figured out how to convert this because the
only character that distinguishes it from battery0 is the “1” at the
end.

{empty}[code] RPM $IIXDR,T,$ERRPM3,R,MAIN ENGINE OIL PRESSURE
$IIXDR,P,$ERXDR?P2*100000,P,MAIN ENGINE COOLANT TEMP
$IIXDR,C,$ERXDR?P6,C,MAIN ENGINE HOURS $IIXDR,G,$ERXDR?P10,H,MAIN HOUSE
BATTERY VOLTAGE $IIXDR,U,$ERXDR?U??????????????????I2,V,HOUS DC AMPERAGE

=== 11. Convert Temperature C to Fahrenheit

Using convert C to F for temp ( $XXMTA, 9/5*$AIMTW5 + 32, F) with send
after all updates variables checked.

* As soon as I start to playback a NMEA stream via VDR plugin or
VDRplayer.py OpenCPN crashes. A look at the O logs does not produce any
clues.
* As a side note I have compiled and used the Tactics plugin with the
same NMEA file with VDRplayer and O and Tactics run just fine.

You are using an ..MTW sentence. Format according my info:

* MTW - Mean Temperature of Water

$–MTW,x.x,C_hh

* This sentence has only 2 fields available, the first one given the
temp value and the second just 'C' for 'Celsius'.
* In your command sentence ($XXMTA, 9/5_$AIMTW5 + 32, F) )
* You are requesting the 5th field of the MTW sentence, but that field
does not exist. Try again with

----
 $XXMTA, 9/5*$AIMTW1 + 32, F

Used new formula provided above.. Still Crashed. I removed the

$Dummy

entry that came with NMEAConverter_pi install. OpenCPN no longer crashes
with NMEAConverter_pi enabled with a NMEA stream present..and as
provided for above

is showing the “Air Temp” in F in Dashboard on O. “I can never thank the
volunteers enough for all these wonderful tools.”

=== 12. Fix bad Heading Checksum

Forum Post]

The problem with the incoming sentence:

[source,code]
----
$APHDM, 113,M*0A
----

Which in this case, is a magnetic heading of 113 degrees followed by a
bad checksum.

Using the NMEA converter sentence, to delete the bad checksum and then
add a new checksum after a forced comma,

[source,code]
----
$IIHDM, $APHDM1", "
----

Which gets converted to a new sentence of $IIHDM,113, *50 with a new
checksum. This assigns the first field of the NMEA sentence from $APHDM
(113) to a new virtual source of $IIHDM

Tim advises:

* As you can see, I now have a heading indicator plus dashboard data.
The NMEA debug window shows the data coming in and being converted.
* I'm sure that I should tweak the conversion command to put M in for
magnetic, plus tidy up commas and stuff (as per Hakan suggestion), but
it is working well, so I am reluctant to “fix” it further just at the
moment…

Dsanduril reports: “The TMQ checksum includes the '$' delimiter
character at the start of the sentence. Per NMEA standard the '$'
delimiter at the start of the sentence and the '*' delimiter at the end
of the sentence should not be included in the checksum. Checksum should
be calculated by XOR of all characters between the delimiters.
[Suggesting that the TMQ AP needs a firmware update to correct the
error.”

From the Nmea Standard:

[source,code]
----
> The checksum is the 8-bit exclusive OR (no start or stop bits) of all characters in the sentence, including "," and "^" delimiters, between but not including the "$" or "!" and the "*" delimiters[emphasis added]. The hexadecimal value of the most significant and least significant 4 bits of the result is converted to two ASCII characters (0-9, A-F (upper case)) for transmission. The most significant character is transmitted first.

=== 13. Change Validity Character - NMEA Converter with the SailAway Game/Simulator

The game SailAway sends realtime NMEA streams that can be used with
plotter software, routing software, etc. The game developers have
elected to send the RMC and GLL sentences with the “V” validity
character, which indicates the data is invalid. OpenCPN rejects the
data. An “A” character is required to show the data is valid.

[source,code]
----
$GPGLL,2546.261,N,7959.8522,W,174650.217,V*3B<0x0D><0x0A>
$GPRMC,174650.217,V,2546.261,N,7959.8522,W,4.9,79,230320,,,*0D<0x0D><0x0A>
----

NMEAconverter can easily adjust these sentences and recalculate the
checksum so that the data is accepted in OpenCPN.

=== 14. Contribute your Formulas & Conversions

If you have an useful format formula please feel free to add it here.

Another future possibility is to do a comparison lookup of a boat's
Polar data and send a special NMEA sentence of the comparative result to
the Dashboard using a special dedicated performance instrument, for
example.

=== Calculations Supported

For calculations the following functions are supported:

==== Normal functions

abs : the absolute value, it removes the sign +
ceil : the smallest integer greater than or equal to x +
cub : x^3, safe way to compute such an exponent +
deg : converts from radian to degree +
exp : the exponential value +
hvi : Heaviside's function, =0 if x<0, =1 if x>=0 +
int : the largest integer less than or equal to x +
inv : inverts, 1/x +
floor : not supported, see int +
ln : the Napierian\natural logarithm +
lnep : see ln +
log : the logarithm base 10 +
rad : converts from degree to radian +
sgn : the sign, -1 or +1. Zero returns +1. +
sqr : x^2, safe way to compute such an exponent +
sqrt : the root square +
pi : 3.14159265 +
deg : 3.14159265/180

==== Trigonometric functions

acos : the secant (inverse of cosine) +
acsh : the inverse of the hyperbolic cosine +
asin : the cosecant (inverse of sine) +
asnh : the inverse of the hyperbolic sine +
atan : the cotangent (inverse of tangent) +
atnh : the inverse of the hyperbolic tangent +
cos : the cosine +
cosh : the hyperbolic cosine +
sin : the sine +
sinc : the cardinal sine (radian) +
sinh : the hyperbolic sine +
tan : the tangent +
tanh : the hyperbolic tangent

This makes it possible to do spreadsheet-like calculations. And as in a
spreadsheet the trigonometric functions use radians.

In beta at this moment:

* An extra checkbox to allow for calculation in degrees instead of
radians.
* “E” bug is fixed.
* “pi” instead of 3.14159265
* “deg” instead of 3.14159265/180
