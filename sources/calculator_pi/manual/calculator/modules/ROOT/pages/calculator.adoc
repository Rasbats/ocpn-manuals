=== Goals

This is a light weight yet powerful calculator plugin for OpenCPN which
includes functions to solve nautical questions.

* Would you like to know your hull speed?
* Increase of draft due to heel.
* More functions can be added by the author.

Key features are:

* Storing results in variables
* Shows historic calculations
* Full complement of nautical functions
* Screen footprint can be optimized & minimized as required

Adding formulas is easy. If your favorite nautical equation is missing,
please let me know your equation via flyspray, and I will add it.

=== Requirements

[source,code]
----
OpenCPN 4.2.0 and above.
Linux or Windows
----

=== Use

*The calculator plugin allows you to carry out all nautical
calculations, without having to leave the OpenCPN environment. The
scientific calculator is capable of working with, and retaining
variables*. +
* When starting the plugin for the first time, go to

image:settings.png[]

to find the plugin tab. Click on the calculator plugin, then the “Enable” button.

* Back in the OpenCPN menu the calculator icon

image:calculator.png[]

brings up the calculator.

image:calculator_screenshot.png[]

* Tick the “Help” tickbox to bring up a comprehensive help screen.
Unticking the help button brings you back to the calculator only
interface and resizes the menu to the original size.
* Enter calculations in the box and press enter or “Calculate” for
evaluation. Press the up or down button, to retrieve historic input and
results (max 30).

=== Help

Type help in the calculator to get these instructions.

=== Examples

*Examples* of expressions that work in the calculator are: _(comments
are in brackets, some results depend on other example calculations)_:

=== Hull speed:

* LWL=48 _(water line length in feet)_
* vhull=1.34*LWL^(1/2) _(hull speed in knots)_

=== Conversions:

* ftm=0.3048 _(feet to meters)_
* km_to_nm=0.539957 _(Kilometers to nautical Mile)_
* ftm*LWL _(waterline length in meters)_

=== Distance to horizon

* R=6378.1*1000 _(Radius of the earth in m)_
* H=2.5 _(Height of the eye above sea-level in m)_
* d = R * acos(R/(R + h)) _(Distance to horizon in m)_
* ans*km_to_nm _(Distance to horizon in nm)_

=== Distance to lighthouse

* H1=200 _(height of lighthouse in m)_
* d1 = R*acos(R/(R + H1)) _(Distance to horizon in m)_
* distance=d1+d _(visibility range of lighthouse in m)_

=== Useful Notes

* *Ans* is the result of the previous calculation
* *Variables* can be defined (e.g. myvariable=10/8*cos(dtr*90) or
yourvariable=Ans)
* % modulus - Divides the value of one expression by the value of
another, and returns the remainder.
* ! factorial
* Sign Returns .-1 for negative numbers and 1 for positive numbers
* Factorial Variables: Pi, e
* dtr is the conversion factor from degrees to radians

==== Built-in functions

The following table gives an overview of the functions supported by the
default implementation. It lists the function names, the number of
arguments and a brief description.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|Name |Argc. |Explanation

|TRIGONOMETRY | |default entry use radians e.g. sin(dtr*90) to calculate
in degrees

|sin |1 |sine function

|cos |1 |cosine function

|tan |1 |tangens function

|asin |1 |arcus sine function

|acos |1 |arcus cosine function

|atan |1 |arcus tangens function

|sinh |1 |hyperbolic sine function

|cosh |1 |hyperbolic cosine

|tanh |1 |hyperbolic tangens function

|asinh |1 |hyperbolic arcus sine function

|acosh |1 |hyperbolic arcus tangens function

|atanh |1 |hyperbolic arcur tangens function

|LOGARITHMIC | |

|log2 |1 |logarithm to the base 2

|log10 |1 |logarithm to the base 10

|log |1 |logarithm to the base 10

|ln |1 |logarithm to base e (2.71828…)

|OTHER | |

|exp |1 |e raised to the power of x

|sqrt |1 |square root of a value

|sign |1 |sign function -1 if x<0; 1 if x>0

|rint |1 |round to nearest integer

|abs |1 |absolute value

|min |var. |min of all arguments

|max |var. |max of all arguments

|sum |var. |sum of all arguments

|avg |var. |mean value of all arguments
|===

=== Built-in binary operators

The following table lists the default binary operators supported by the
parser.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|Operator |Meaning |Priority
|= |assignment |-1
|&& |logical and |1
||| |logical or |2
|⇐ |less or equal |4
|>= |greater or equal |4
|!= |not equal |4
|== |equal |4
|> |greater than |4
|< |less than |4
|+ |addition |5
|- |subtraction |5
|* |multiplication |6
|/ |division |6
|^ |raise x to the power of y |7
|^ |use ^(1/2) for square root |7
|===

* The assignment operator is special since it changes one of its
arguments and can only by applied to variables.

=== Other operators

=== MuParser

*muParser* has built in support for the _if.. then.. else_ operator. It
uses lazy evaluation in order to make sure only the necessary branch of
the expression is evaluated.


[cols=",",]
|===
|Operator |Meaning
|?: |if then else operator
|===


=== Variables:

[cols=",",]
|===
|pi, e |well known

|ans |the result of the previous calculation

|dtr |conversion factor from degrees to radians

|Define variables |e.g. myvariable=10/8*cos(dtr*90) or yourvariable=ans

|clear |removes results in the history and leaves defined variables in
tact
|===


=== User Interface:

Type these commands in the command window:

[cols=",",]
|===
|history |Toggle the history panel
|showhelp |Show/Hide the Help button
|showcalculate |Show/Hide the Calculate button
|showhistory |Show/Hide the history toggle
|help |show the help menu
|===

==== Settings/Plugins/Preferences:

* Show/Hide Calculate
* Help and History toggle buttons
* History Settings: max Results -this is the number of results that will
be stored in the history pull down. The history pulldown will contain
five times this value.
* Log to opencpn: Enable/Disable logging of results to opencpn logfile.

=== Other:

* Error handling supported
* MuParser has been compiled with C++ Double for internal precision.

=== Compiling

You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info
athttp://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual[Developers Manual]

* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/Calc_pi_muparser.git

Build out of OpenCPN branch!

in folder calculator_pi

* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* sudo make installf

After using wxformbuilder to modify the interface, use degreefix.sh, to
facilitate the windows build. When updating the Excel file with formulas
and conversions, convert to cpp code by running the supplied perl script

=== Changes to version 1.6

* Added Willson Fetch Equation
* Added wind speed to Beaufort equation
* Changed to MuParser math interface
* Added History pulldown box, improved history box behaviour
* Added reporting modes (1000 separator, SI prefixes, accuracy)
* Added function button in OpenCPN toolbar, with option to switch off
from plugin settings
* Minor tweaks and fixes

=== Support for Diagrams

I believe the plugin supports small jpg & png images for the purpose of
better visualization. What is needed to implement this system is some
diagrams and more knowledge about the plugin. Rgleason
