== Pypilot Autopilot

The pypilot plugin provides an interface to the free software autopilot
pypilot. Control, configure and calibrate the autopilot from OpenCPN.

The Pypilot_pi interface plugin will work with any operating system
running opencpn (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android are available). The
Pypilot_pi interface plugin is separate and distinct from the plugin
“autopilot_route_pi”.

The pypilot server that pypilot_pi connects to, so far typically runs on
raspberry pi, but it can work on orange pi or potentially other systems
as well.

Note: OpenCPN can communicate with pypilot server already via nmea to
receive compass heading, and to autopilot, and this plugin is not
strictly required. The plugin allows for configuration and tuning of the
autopilot in ways not possible through basic nmea0183 messaging. The
plugin also allows for graphical overlays of the autopilot settings
directly onto the chart.

https://github.com/pypilot/pypilot/wiki/webapp[Pypilot Webapp] if using
tinypilot, creates a webserver which provides remote autopilot control
through a browser. Trimaran test used rtlsdr IR remote for control. It
can use any tv remote, also buttons, or gui program through openplotter.

This Autopilot uses modified and improved versions of SignalK and
RTMUlib2. More details are available in the

Pypilot is free software like Opencpn and it is fully supported by
opencpn, and is better supported than any autopilot. It has 2
specialized opencpn plugins designed for it. For the cost of a raspberry
pi, some $4 sensors, and a motor controller you can build, or buy for
$75 and just use a windshield wiper motor and a belt to the wheel, or if
you have a tiller:
