==== B. Why can Chartscale-pi be useful

Normally you use the (+) and (-) buttons or the scroll-wheel of your
mouse for zooning in and out. But maybe you prefer tou use a slider. The
position of the slider (far left, far right or somewhere in between)
gives you a direct indication of the zoom-status. +

Click “*OK*” in the Chart Scale Preferences window and then “*OK*” in
the Plugins-window. +

Now the Chart Scale slider should appear on your screen.

In this example the slider-button is to the far left. That means “zoom
in as far as possible”.

And in this example the slider-button is to the far right. That means
“zoom out as far as possible”.
