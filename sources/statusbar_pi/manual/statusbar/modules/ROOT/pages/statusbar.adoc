== 1. What and Why

=== What can StatusBar do?

Shows Dashboard and Nmea Data at the bottom of the screen in various
formats.

=== Why is StatusBar useful?

Informs the skipper of conditions that are useful in navigation.
StatusBar plugin replaces builtin statusbar. The builtin status bar
(disable from the User Interface tab) can be very difficult to read.

The statusbar plugin improves on some of these difficulties. It is best
used with OpenGL enabled (requires some basic OpenGL extensions).
