This document is about the 'sar_pi' plugin, which we will refer to as
SAR-pi in this manual. The plugin was developed by SaltyPaws, based on
the (external) software “SAR Search patterns” by Andres Ruiz González.
Rasbats has updated the plugin, following advice from an Australian SAR
Operations Centre Coordinator, Stephen Hancock. RGLeason has contributed
ideas for the GUI.

This document is not meant to replace official SAR manuals.

The sole purpose of this document is to explain SAR-pi so that you can
use that plugin in OpenCPN.

SAR-pi generates GPX files for search and rescue search patterns.

=== What and Why

==== What does SAR-pi do?

SAR-pi is a plugin that can generate different types of Search and
Rescue search patterns directly from within OpenCPN. +
You can save these patterns as GPX files.

These GPX files can then be loaded in OpenCPN and used as routes to
follow in order to perform an efficiënt search and rescue operation.

*Note*: In this document “Search And Rescue will be shortened to
“*SAR*”.

==== Why should I want it?

When a SAR operation is necessary, there is absolutely no time to lose.

It can be a fellow sailor who is in distress, or a loved-one who fell
overboard during a dark and rough night.

It is very important that your search operation is as efficiënt as
possible. Meaning that with the required speed you cover a maximum of
the search-area in a minimum of time. In order to achieve that, it is
best to follow certain patterns. These search-patterns have proven to
give the best results for certain conditions.

When the need arises, you can start thinking about making a search
pattern. And then you have to actually lay out that pattern as a track
or route to follow. But that will take you some time and it requires
clear thinking. And especially in those situations “clear thinking” is
challenged by a lot of other worries on your mind.

*Let SAR-pi do the work for you!*

Note: in most circumstances SAR operations are coördinated by the Coast
Guard or other professional search and rescue-organisations. These
operations are coordinated and executed by highly trained specialists
and follow specific rules and procedures.

*This manual is meant primarily for situations where you are on your own
and you are the first (or only) ship in the vicinity.*

=== First things first, choose the right search-pattern.

There is no time to lose, so choose a search pattern that is best suited
for the situation.

*In short*:

==== Choose Parallel track search:

* *to search a large area when the location of the search object is
uncertain.*

==== Choose Expanding Square Search:

* *when the location of the search object is known within relatively
close limits;*
* when searching for *persons in the water or other search objects with
little or no leeway*.

(but keep in mind: this procedure is *less suited to be used
simultaneously by multiple vessels)*

==== Choose Sector search:

* *when the position of the search object is accurately known and the
search area is small.*

(but keep in mind: this procedure is *less suited to be used
simultaneously by multiple vessels)*

==== Choose Oil Rig:

* when you want to search just *one quadrant relative to a fixed
position*.

*Important:* Consider the sea conditions, visibility, target type, drift
and speed of the searching vessel when deciding both the search pattern
type and the spacing used for the pattern.

=== Terminology

Nobody is eager to get involved in a situation that necessitates a
SAR-operation. Not as the object that has to be found and not as a
vessel that participates in the SAR-operation. But if you do, you will
have to understand that one of the keys to a successful operation is
coordination and the avoidance of miscommunication. That involves
understanding some specific terms and abbreviations.

* *SRU*: Search and Rescue Unit (for instance: your ship).
* *Search speed*: This is the speed of the searching ship. *Note:* the
higher the speed, the greater the distance you can cover in a given
time. But high speed might also result in a bigger risk of passing the
position of the searched object without noticing that object.
* *Search Area*: the area most likely to contain the search object.
* *Datum*: the Datum is the most probable location of a search object,
corrected for movement over time (drift). So that's the place we would
normally begin our search.
* *Search Leg*: a Search Leg is the long leg of a parallel search
pattern.
* *Cross Leg*: a Cross Leg is a connection between two search legs of a
parallel search pattern.
* *Sweep Width*: the distance an SRU should be able to detect the search
object on either side of the leg. Sweep Width will be affected by the
height of the observer and the weather-conditions. A clear day and calm
sea will give a larger Sweep Width than a stormy night. type or size of
the target, A distressed vessel will be easier to see than a head in the
water.
* *Leg Spacing*: the distance between two parallel Search Legs. That
distance should be no more than 2x Sweep Width.
* *RCC: Rescue coordination centre*: A unit responsible for promoting
efficient organization of search and rescue services and for
coordinating the conduct of search and rescue operations within a search
and rescue region.The RCC normally assigns a SMC.
* *SMC: SAR Mission Coordinator*: The official temporarily assigned to
coordinate response to an actual or apparent distress situation. The SMC
can assign an *OSC*.
* *OSC: On-scene coordinator*: A person designated to coordinate search
and rescue operations within a specified area.
* *CSP: Commence Search Point*: Point, normally specified by the SMC,
where a SRU is to begin its search pattern.

=== On-scene coordination

When two or more SRU's are working together on the same mission, one
person on scene may be needed to coordinate the activities of all
participating SRU's.

The person in charge of the first SRU to arrive at the scene will
normally assume the OSC function until the SMC arranges for that person
to be relieved.

The OSC is normally a person in charge of a:

* ship or aircraft participating in a search, or
* nearby facility in a position to handle OSC duties.

=== Initiation of search

* *When a SRU arrives on-scene in advance of the others, it should
proceed directly to datum and commence an expanding square search*.
* If possible, *datum may be marked by putting over a liferaft or other
floating marker with a leeway similar to that of the search object, as a
check on the drift*.
* This can then be used as a datum marker throughout the search.
* As other SRU's arrive, the OSC should select one of the search
patterns, as appropriate, and allocate search sub-areas to individual
SRU's.
* In good visibility and with sufficient SRU's, the OSC may let the
first SRU continue its expanding square search while the others conduct
a parallel track search through the same area.

In restricted visibility, or if sufficient SRU's are not available, it
will probably be better to have the first SRU break off the expanding
square search and be available for initiation of a parallel track
search.

=== On-board preparation

Search patterns are for the “S”-part of SAR. But let's not forget the
“R”-part (after all, that “R”-part is the one and only reason for the
“S”-part). So prepare yourself to do what has to be done once the search
proves succesful. That will probably be:

* assisting distressed craft and/or
* recovering people from survival-craft or from the water.

*Be aware of drift!*

Precise search pattern navigation using high-precision methods such as
GPS-systems will produce good patterns relative to the ocean bottom,
*but not relative to the drifting search object*. This could allow the
search object to drift out of the search area. *Therefore the currents
and other forces affecting the search object's drift during the search
should be taken into careful consideration*. If a smoke float or other
highly visible, expendable object is available, it should be deployed at
datum and the pattern should be performed relative to it.

*Be aware of the risks involved!*

Vessels proceeding to assist should assess the risks they may encounter
on scene, including the risks such as those associated with leaking
cargo, etc. Information should be sought as necessary from the
distressed craft and/or from the RCC or, if no RCC is involved, the OSC.

=== Installation

*Note*: In this section the instructions are specifically for SAR-pi,
but there is a dedicated page in the manual with information about
Downloading, Installing and Enabling Plugins in general. That dedicated
page can be found here:
https://www.opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:plugins:install_and_enable[Plugins-Install
and Enable.]

==== Downloading

SAR-pi can be downloaded from http://www.opencpn.org/index.html

Click “*Downloads*”

Click “*Plugins for OpenCPN*” Look for “*SAR*””

image::sar_download.png[]

==== Installing

How to install the plugin.

Make sure you choose the file that is compatible with your computer
system. In this manual we presume it's Windows, so we choose the Windows
setup-package. Download the file (double-click). We assume you know
where to find the files you download from the Internet (if you don't:
quit now and read the manual of your computer before doing anything else
with it ). Double-click the downloaded file and follow the set-up
instructions. That's it. But before you can actually use the plugin, you
first have to enable that plug-in in OpenCPN.

==== Enabling

Enabling the plugin in OpenCPN.

Open (or restart) OpenCPN.

Click *Tools-Options-Plugins*.

Scroll down untill you see the *SAR*.

Click “*Enabled*”.

image::1.0.jpeg[]

==== 

Now the SAR-pi icon should appear somewhere in your OpenCPN Toolbar.

image::2.0.jpeg[]

link:sar.html[Back to top of page ↑]

=== Search Patterns

The ability to quickly deploy efficient search and rescue patterns is
relevant since no matter how developed our means of transportation may
get, the possibility of an emergency arising due to an accident or other
reasons can never be ruled out. Specific SAR patterns have been worked
out to deal with maritime emergencies. These various search and rescue
patterns will be explained below.

*Types of Search and Rescue Patterns*

SAR-pi can generate 4 different types of search patterns. They are:

* *Parallel Track*
* *Expanding Square*
* *Sector Search*
* *Oil Rig (Quadrant Single)*

In the section “*Operation*” we will explain the patterns in some more
detail.

link:sar.html[Back to top of page ↑]

=== Standard Actions

Click the *SAR icon* in the Toolbar

image::3.0.jpeg[]

Choose the desired search pattern. In this example: *Parallel Track*

The plugin has a window with two sections: the top half and the bottom
half.

==== Top half of the window

Here you can set the type of search-pattern. The initial pattern is the
type “Parallel Track”.

image::3.01.jpeg[]

In each search pattern you can enter several parameters, for instance
the search speed. They will be explained in more detail in the specific
section for each type of pattern There are also buttons to calculate the
distance and time of the search pattern and to generate a GPX file for
that pattern.

But before you generate the GPX file, go to the bottom half of the
window.

==== Bottom half of the window

image::3.02.jpeg[]

The *bottom half of the window* is for entering the start-position of
the search pattern and for showing the results (the distance of the
calculated search pattern and the time it will take to complete that
pattern).

When the parameters for the search-pattern are entered, you can click
“*Calculate*”. In the case of the Parallel Track search the Commence
Search Point (CSP) is not the datum. The CSP must be chosen to optimise
the outcome of the search, based on likely drift and time since the
casualty was reported. A warning message advises that the CSP is being
used.

image::3.1.jpeg[]

and find out that (in this example) the pattern will cover 41 NM and
will take 8.2 hours to complete.

image::3.11.jpeg[]

If you want the search pattern to start at your *ship's* position and
the GPS is feeding OpenCPN with that information, you go to the bottom
half of the window and click “Ship”.

image::3.02.jpeg[]

You can also use the position of your *cursor* on the screen. For
instance when you are still some distance away from the area where the
search has to take place. A message will pop up to tell you to move the
cursor to the position on the chart and press Ctrl-S.

image::3.03.jpeg[]

A third option is to enter latitude and longitude of the starting
position by hand.

For example: you hear a MAYDAY of a ship that is sinking in position 33
degrees 46.5 minutes North / 068 degrees 51.5 minutes West.

Fill in the position and click “Convert to degree”.

image::3.15.jpeg[]

The final option is to use 'Right-Click' on the position for the Datum
Point/CSP. Use the option 'Select SAR Datum Point' to transfer that
position to the dialog.

image::3.14.jpeg[]

Now click “Generate GPX”.

We save the file in a folder where we can easily find it. For instance
in the folder “SAR”.

Abbreviations are used professionally for the different search patterns.
The plugin tries to reflect these, not only in the default GPX file
names but also in the routes that appear when imported into OpenCPN.

* *PS* Parallel Track search with a single unit.
* *SS* Expanding Square (Square Search)
* *VS* Sector Search (Vector Search)
* *QS* Oil Rig (Quadrant Search)

image::3.16.jpeg[]

link:sar.html[Back to top of page ↑]

==== How to use the SAR search pattern in OpenCPN

Go in the OpenCPN Toolbar to “Route & Mark Manager” and import the
GPX-file as a route.

image::3.17.jpeg[]

image::3.18.jpeg[]

The search pattern will show up as a new route. Make sure it is
“visible” (the “eye” should be open). You can inspect the properties of
the route. If you have upgraded to OpenCPN 5.2 the speed you choose for
the search will be used for the route calculations. For OpenCPN 5.0 you
need to enter the speed and update the route properties.

image::3.19.jpeg[]

The standard actions can be summed up as:

. Choose the desired search pattern “Parallel Track”, “Expanding
Square”, “Sector Search” or “Oil Rig (Quadrant Single)”.
. Enter the parameters.
. Click “Calculate” to find out how long the search track will be in
nautical miles and how long it will take you to complete that search.
. Click “Generate GPX” to generate a GPX file of the search pattern.
. Open “Route and Mark Manager”
. In the “Route” tab, Click “Import GPX”
. Find the GPX-file you just generated and click “OK”.
. The search pattern will appear on your screen and can be used as a
route.

=== Operation

=== "Parallel Track" Search

Keywords:

* LARGE AREA
* POSITION OF SEARCH OBJECT APPROXIMATE
* UNIFORM COVERAGE DESIRED
* SEARCH LEGS PARALLEL

Parallel Track Search:

* is used to search a *large area when survivor location is uncertain*.
* is usually used when a large search area must be divided into
sub-areas for assignment to individual SRU's on-scene at the same time.
* has search legs with their longest side oriented true north or, when
drift has to be considered, oriented in the direction of the drift line.
* can be undertaken with one or more vessels (preferably with at least
two ships).

*Risk with restricted visibility*

A parallel track search in restricted visibility poses problems because
of the following considerations:

* desirability of reducing the interval between SRU's as much as
possible consistent with safety resulting loss of search area coverage;
* potential risk of collision

=== Setting up a "Parallel Track" pattern.

Click the SAR icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In
this case: Parallel Track.

We have already seen the first parallel track search pattern in Standard
actions. This was made using the default 'Starboard' button. It is for
one unit and the first turn of the pattern is to starboard.

image::3.192.jpeg[]

We can choose to make the first turn to port.

image::3.193.jpeg[]

If two units are available we can generate the patterns for the two
units as separate routes in a single GPX file.

image::3.194.jpeg[]

For the first turn “Starboard” selection the following parameters were
used:

* Initial leg course = 030 degrees
* Search Leg length = 3 NM
* Track Space = 0.5 NM
* Number of Legs = 4
* Search Speed = 5 knots

*“Initial leg course”*

The Initial leg course is the direction you want the “legs” to point.
Normally this will be at 90 degrees to the direction of the drift or, if
no drift has to be taken into account, true north. In the following
example we have entered 030 degrees (roughly Nort-East).

*“Search Leg length”*

This is the length in nautical miles of each leg.

*“Track space”*

This is the distance in nautical miles between two (parallel) legs.

*Note*: when the lookout is positioned high above the water, for
instance in a crow's nest, the lookout has a better view and can see
object further away than when he would be positioned low above the
water. In such cases the distance between the legs can be greater than
when the lookout is low above the water. See also the explanation of
“Sweep Width”.

*“Number of legs”*

This the number of legs you want to use in the search pattern. The
higher the number, the more legs and the longer the search pattern.

*“Search speed”*

This is the speed of the searching ship. *Note*: the higher the speed,
the greater the distance you can cover in a given time. But high speed
might also result in a bigger risk of passing the position of the
searched object without noticing that object.

We use the position of our cursor as the starting point (as described
under “Standard Actions”),

Back in the top half of the window we click “*Generate GPX*” and save
the GPX-file (as described under “Standard Actions”)

In OpenCPN we open the GPX-file as a route (as described under “Standard
Actions”) and this is the result.

image::3.195.jpeg[]

The pattern has 4 legs, 0.5 nm apart from each other and the first leg
is orientated in the direction 030.

Activate the route and start your SAR operation!

*Note*: in these screenshots the “own ship” icon is pointing upwards
(away from the starting-point). There is no GPS feed.

image::3.196.jpeg[]

link:sar.html[Back to top of page ↑]

==== Parallel Search with 2 ships.

If there are two ships participating in the search, you use the option
“2 units A&B”. We assume the “mothership” launches her (faster) RIB.

image::3.170.jpeg[]

Repeat the process of creating the GPX file, saving it and opening it as
a route in OpenCPN.

This is the result with both of the routes shown.

image::3.197.jpeg[]

The search-pattern for ship B is the route coloured red.

Let us assume that ship B is a RIB that can easily cruise at 15 knots.
When we look at the two routes PS-AB-1 and PS-AB-2 they initially have
the same speed. Using the route manager it is possible to change the
planned speed for ship 2 (B) from 5kts to 15kts in order to estimate the
time the rib will take on that part of the search.

*Note*: Suppose there are two ships. One is the relatively big and slow
but comfortable mother-ship with her well-equipped navigational area
(and of course OpenCPN plus SAR-plugin). The other ship is the small and
fast but very uncomfortable RIB that's speeding towards the search-area.
Now it is possible to generate the SAR-patterns in the relative comfort
of the mother-ship (or even from a shore-based station) and then send
the generated GPX-file(s) via email to one or more other ships. Like
that RIB. There that GPX-file can be received (and used!) on a mobile
phone that has OpenCPN for Android!

a parallel track search through the same area.

In restricted visibility, or if sufficient SRU's are not available, it
will probably be better to have the first SRU break off the expanding

search.

the search pattern and for showing the results (the distance of the
calculated search pattern and the time it will take to complete that
pattern).

When the parameters for the search-pattern are entered, you can click
“*Calculate*”. In the case of the Parallel Track search the Commence
Search Point (CSP) is not the datum. The CSP must be chosen to optimise
the outcome of the search, based on likely drift and time since the
casualty was reported. A warning message advises that the CSP is being
used.

and find out that (in this example) the pattern will cover 41 NM and
will take 8.2 hours to complete.

image::3.11.jpeg[]

If you want the search pattern to start at your *ship's* position and
the GPS is feeding OpenCPN with that information, you go to the bottom
half of the window and click “Ship”.

image::3.02.jpeg[]

You can also use the position of your *cursor* on the screen. For
instance when you are still some distance away from the area where the
search has to take place. A message will pop up to tell you to move the
cursor to the position on the chart and press Ctrl-S.

image::3.03.jpeg[]

A third option is to enter latitude and longitude of the starting
position by hand.

For example: you hear a MAYDAY of a ship that is sinking in position 33
degrees 46.5 minutes North / 068 degrees 51.5 minutes West.

Fill in the position and click “Convert to degree”.

image::3.15.jpeg[]

The final option is to use 'Right-Click' on the position for the Datum
Point/CSP. Use the option 'Select SAR Datum Point' to transfer that
position to the dialog.

image::3.14.jpeg[]

Now click “Generate GPX”.

We save the file in a folder where we can easily find it. For instance
in the folder “SAR”.

Abbreviations are used professionally for the different search patterns.
The plugin tries to reflect these, not only in the default GPX file
names but also in the routes that appear when imported into OpenCPN.

* *PS* Parallel Track search with a single unit.
* *SS* Expanding Square (Square Search)
* *VS* Sector Search (Vector Search)
* *QS* Oil Rig (Quadrant Search)

==== How to use the SAR search pattern in OpenCPN

Go in the OpenCPN Toolbar to “Route & Mark Manager” and import the
GPX-file as a route.

image::3.17.jpeg[]

image::3.18.jpeg[]

The search pattern will show up as a new route. Make sure it is
“visible” (the “eye” should be open). You can inspect the properties of
the route. If you have upgraded to OpenCPN 5.2 the speed you choose for
the search will be used for the route calculations. For OpenCPN 5.0 you
need to enter the speed and update the route properties.

image::3.19.jpeg[]

The standard actions can be summed up as:

. Choose the desired search pattern “Parallel Track”, “Expanding
Square”, “Sector Search” or “Oil Rig (Quadrant Single)”.
. Enter the parameters.
. Click “Calculate” to find out how long the search track will be in
nautical miles and how long it will take you to complete that search.
. Click “Generate GPX” to generate a GPX file of the search pattern.
. Open “Route and Mark Manager”
. In the “Route” tab, Click “Import GPX”
. Find the GPX-file you just generated and click “OK”.
. The search pattern will appear on your screen and can be used as a
route.

=== Operation

=== "Parallel Track" Search

Keywords:

* LARGE AREA
* POSITION OF SEARCH OBJECT APPROXIMATE
* UNIFORM COVERAGE DESIRED
* SEARCH LEGS PARALLEL

Parallel Track Search:

* is used to search a *large area when survivor location is uncertain*.
* is usually used when a large search area must be divided into
sub-areas for assignment to individual SRU's on-scene at the same time.
* has search legs with their longest side oriented true north or, when
drift has to be considered, oriented in the direction of the drift line.
* can be undertaken with one or more vessels (preferably with at least
two ships).

*Risk with restricted visibility*

A parallel track search in restricted visibility poses problems because
of the following considerations:

* desirability of reducing the interval between SRU's as much as
possible consistent with safety resulting loss of search area coverage;
* potential risk of collision

=== Setting up a "Parallel Track" pattern.

Click the SAR icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In
this case: Parallel Track.

We have already seen the first parallel track search pattern in Standard
actions. This was made using the default 'Starboard' button. It is for
one unit and the first turn of the pattern is to starboard.

image::3.192.jpeg[]

We can choose to make the first turn to port.

image::3.193.jpeg[]

If two units are available we can generate the patterns for the two
units as separate routes in a single GPX file.

image::3.194.jpeg[]

For the first turn “Starboard” selection the following parameters were
used:

* Initial leg course = 030 degrees
* Search Leg length = 3 NM
* Track Space = 0.5 NM
* Number of Legs = 4
* Search Speed = 5 knots

*“Initial leg course”*

The Initial leg course is the direction you want the “legs” to point.
Normally this will be at 90 degrees to the direction of the drift or, if
no drift has to be taken into account, true north. In the following
example we have entered 030 degrees (roughly Nort-East).

*“Search Leg length”*

This is the length in nautical miles of each leg.

*“Track space”*

This is the distance in nautical miles between two (parallel) legs.

*Note*: when the lookout is positioned high above the water, for
instance in a crow's nest, the lookout has a better view and can see
object further away than when he would be positioned low above the
water. In such cases the distance between the legs can be greater than
when the lookout is low above the water. See also the explanation of
“Sweep Width”.

*“Number of legs”*

This the number of legs you want to use in the search pattern. The
higher the number, the more legs and the longer the search pattern.

*“Search speed”*

This is the speed of the searching ship. *Note*: the higher the speed,
the greater the distance you can cover in a given time. But high speed
might also result in a bigger risk of passing the position of the
searched object without noticing that object.

We use the position of our cursor as the starting point (as described
under “Standard Actions”),

Back in the top half of the window we click “*Generate GPX*” and save
the GPX-file (as described under “Standard Actions”)

In OpenCPN we open the GPX-file as a route (as described under “Standard
Actions”) and this is the result.

image::3.195.jpeg[]

The pattern has 4 legs, 0.5 nm apart from each other and the first leg
is orientated in the direction 030.

Activate the route and start your SAR operation!

*Note*: in these screenshots the “own ship” icon is pointing upwards
(away from the starting-point). There is no GPS feed.

image::3.196.jpeg[]

==== Parallel Search with 2 ships.

If there are two ships participating in the search, you use the option
“2 units A&B”. We assume the “mothership” launches her (faster) RIB.

image::3.170.jpeg[]

Repeat the process of creating the GPX file, saving it and opening it as
a route in OpenCPN.

This is the result with both of the routes shown.

image::3.197.jpeg[]

The search-pattern for ship B is the route coloured red.

Let us assume that ship B is a RIB that can easily cruise at 15 knots.
When we look at the two routes PS-AB-1 and PS-AB-2 they initially have
the same speed. Using the route manager it is possible to change the
planned speed for ship 2 (B) from 5kts to 15kts in order to estimate the
time the rib will take on that part of the search.

*Note*: Suppose there are two ships. One is the relatively big and slow
but comfortable mother-ship with her well-equipped navigational area
(and of course OpenCPN plus SAR-plugin). The other ship is the small and
fast but very uncomfortable RIB that's speeding towards the search-area.
Now it is possible to generate the SAR-patterns in the relative comfort
of the mother-ship (or even from a shore-based station) and then send
the generated GPX-file(s) via email to one or more other ships. Like
that RIB. There that GPX-file can be received (and used!) on a mobile
phone that has OpenCPN for Android!

=== "Expanding Square"

Keywords:

* SMALL AREA
* FIRST SEARCH LEG IS EITHER DIRECTION OF DRIFT OR TRUE NORTH
* ALL TURNS ARE 90º TO THE RIGHT
* TRACK SPACING DETERMINES 1ST AND 2ND LEG THEN ADD ONE TRACK SPACING
EVERY OTHER LEG

Starting at the probable location of the target, the search vessels
expand outward in concentric squares.

This pattern is the most effective pattern *when the location of the
search object is known within relatively close limits*.

The commence search point is always the datum position. The first leg
should be in the direction of wind and tide.

Expanding square search is often appropriate for vessels or small boats
to use when searching for *persons in the water or other search objects
with little or no leeway*.

Due to the small area involved, this procedure is *less suited to be
used simultaneously by* *multiplevessels.*

=== Setting up a "Expanding Square" search pattern.

Click the SAR-icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In
this case: Expanding Square.

The parameter-window shows these fields:

image::4.0.jpeg[]

The initial course should be set in the direction of the drift, or else
to 000 (true North). The rest should be easy to understand, so we will
not explain this further.

Following the steps described in “Standard Actions” and using the
parameters in the screenshot will give a result that looks like this:

=== "Sector Search"

Keywords:

* RELIABLE POSITION OF SEARCH OBJECT
* SMALL SEARCH AREA
* DATUM AT CENTER
* STARTS AND ENDS AT DATUM
* ALL TURNS ARE 120º TO THE RIGHT
* 1ST LEG IN DIRECTION OF DRIFT

The sector search is employed when the position of the lost ship or lost
body is known accurately and the search has to be carried over a small
area, say with each leg a length of no more than 2 to 5 NM. It is
normally carried out in the area where the casualty or the object has
been sighted.

=== IAMSAR

The search pattern starts from the Commence Search Point (CSP). The
initial course then passes through the datum.

Keywords:

normally carried out in the area where the casualty or the object has

=== IAMSAR

The search pattern starts from the Commence Search Point (CSP). The
initial course then passes through the datum and should be in the
direction of the wind/tide or overall drift.

=== USCG

The search pattern starts from the datum point and continues on the
initial course.

This pattern gives a very high probability of detection close to the
datum point and spreads the search over the probable area quickly. With
a man overboard, the ship returns immediately to the datum or, if the
search target is once sighted and then lost, the ship heads for the
datum.

All turns are 120 degrees to starboard. Upon completion of the search
pattern, re-orient the pattern 30 degrees to the right and search a new
pattern (see the dashed lines).

The advantage of this pattern is that the search vessels cross the datum
a number of times. The first step is to determine the drift and carry
out the operations in that direction (first leg in the direction of the
drift).

A suitable marker (for example, a smoke float or a radio beacon) may be
dropped at the datum position and used as a reference or navigational
aid marking the centre of the pattern.

An aircraft and a vessel may be used together to perform independent
sector searches of the same area.

*NOTE*: Due to the small area involved and the fact that the search
vessels cross the datum a number of times, this procedure is less suited
to be used simultaneously by (a lot of) multiple vessels.

*Note:* This search pattern is not shown in the IAMSAR manual or USCG
publications.

Keywords:

* FROM STATIONARY OBJECT
* QUADRANT

In the so-called “oil rig pattern”, the search sectors are placed into a
quadrant.

This pattern is meant to be used when someone has fallen from a
stationary object (like an oil rig is, or at least is supposed to be)
and the search area is confined to one quadrant.
