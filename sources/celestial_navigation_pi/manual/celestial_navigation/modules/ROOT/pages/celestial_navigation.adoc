== Celestial Navigation

=== Plugin to record Sextant Sights and show Circles of Position to obtain a Fix

Celestial navigation support makes it possible to establish your
position when other means are not available. Also, users may find this
plugin, which is still under development, useful for cross checking
their position fixes obtained in other ways, or to to better visualize a
celestial fix. You find the forum thread here:

==== Types of Observations

Currently 3 types of observations are, more or less, supported:

. *Altitude* (sextant measurement) – Measure the angle between the
horizon and a heavenly body, and enter the required data in the plugin.
Each measurement results in a Circle of Position on the sphere (COP, or
Circle of Equal Altitude). Two or more observations result in
intersecting COP's from which a position fix can be obtained.
. *Azimuth* (compass measurement) – Measure the azimuth (bearing) of a
heavenly body. This method is hopelessly inaccurate, especially on a
small boat in high seas. However, it is interesting for demonstration
purposes, and possibly - with accurate digital compasses - it may be a
viable navigation method in the future.
. *Lunar distance* (sextant measurement) – Measure the angle between two
heavenly bodies. The computer then attempts to determine clock error
from this measurement, and the system time may be corrected.

=== Process

==== 1. Obtaining Sights with Sextant

Standard practice in navy and merchant navy with regard to celestial
positioning is as follows (assuming no artificial horizon is available
on the sextant):

. During morning nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take
6 star/planet observations.
. In the morning at about 09:00LT: take a Sun's observation (later to be
shifted to noon-time).
. At local noon: take a Sun's observation (traditionally only direct
latitude calculation from sun at meridian passage). Construct a fix for
noon from both sun observations.
. During evening nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take
6 star/planet observations.
. Use the Moon for an observation in above practice when situation
permits.

Many books have been written about the art and science of celestial
positioning (see below).

This is the document containing the test data used for the example
below:

image::textbook_data.pdf[] 

(4 star observations).

==== 2. Sight Properties - Sight Tab - Enter Star Data

Enter Type (Altitude, Azimuth, Lunar), Celestial Body, Limb, Measurement
and Degrees of Certainty. Degrees of Certainty is the accuracy the
navigator assumes for the observation. A larger value results in a
larger line width for the Circle of Position on the chart.

image::sight-1-degrees-minutes-uncertainty.png[image::sight-1-degrees-minutes-uncertainty.png[image,width=399,height=272]]

==== 3. Sight Properties - Date and Time Tab

Enter Date (based on GMT/UT) and Time in GMT/UT, Certainty and Shift.
Note that entering a shift removes the calculated numerical fix. This is
due to the computation method used, which presently does not allow to
shift COP's. However, a position fix can be established by visually
observing the COP's (which are graphically shifted) on the chart.

The date and time is populated using current computer time and time zone
(verify your computer's time), to match the Greenwich UTC Date & Time.
Times for sights are entered in UTC. Sights are likely taken
extemporaneously with time details, unique exact time for each sight
must be entered separately, overriding the computer time & date.

image::sight-2-date-time-certainty-shift.png[]

==== 4. DR Shift - Distance and Bearing

image::sights-dr-shift.png.detail.html[image::sights-dr-shift.png[DR
Shift,title="DR Shift",width=400]]

When a DR Shift with values > 0 is entered the Circle of Position will
shift accordingly, the “Fix” button will not compute and the Fix must be
done manually.

The DR Shift is used to “advance” a sight to the time of last sight in a
“group of sights” which have been taken at different times (usually 1-5
minutes apart), so that the fix can e more accurately determined.

. The navigator first measures the range and bearing of the sight that
is to be “advanced” to the last sight of the group.
. These values are then entered into DR Shift and the program simply
adjusts the Circle of Position to the time of the last sight of the
group.
. The actual “Fix” must be done by manual inspection and dropping a
waypoint at the selected location and labeling it “Fix” with the date
and time labeled.

explanation.

==== 5. Sight Properties - Config Tab - Display Characteristics

Enter Transparency and Color you wish to use for the COP.

==== 6. Sight Properties - Parameters Tab

Enter Eye Height, Temperature, Pressure and Index Error.

image::sight-4-parameters.png[]

==== 7. Sight Properties - Calculations Tab

Showing the input figures and some calculated results for the
observation. Together with the calculated numerical position fix showed
in the main window of the plugin, this can be used for comparison with
results that are obtained by other calculation methods (traditional
manual method using logarithms, traditional or direct computation
methods as mentioned in Nautical Almanac, shortened methods using e.g.
http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&pubCode=0013[US
Pub. 229] or http://thenauticalalmanac.com/[US Pub. 249], other computer
applications).

image::sight-5-calculations.png[]

==== 8. Celestial Navigation Sights - Circles of Position and Sights

A Circle of Position (COP) indicates all the positions on earth where a
navigator may observe the same altitude of a heavenly body at a certain
time. Using traditional methods, only the part of a COP the navigator is
interested in is used, and replaced by a tangent line (LOP).

image::four-circles-of-position.png[]

==== 9. Four Circles of Position (showing DR position as MOB and fix as Waypoint)

The MOB icon shows the initial DR position entered. The red circle
indicates the intersection of the crossing red lines, the calculated
position fix. Hover cursor over the crossing, right click and place a
mark. If required, visually adjust this to get best latitude and
longitude of the fix. In Sight Properties - Sight Tab, Degrees Certainty
was set to 0.05.

=== Methodology

Videos by David Burch, https://www.starpath.com/index.htm[Starpath

This computer assisted process is a little different than traditional
techniques because Circles of Position are calculated using the Simbad
database for stars and lunar and the sight circles and intersections are
neatly represented in the standard Opencpn interface. David Burch
(Starpath.com) has completed a number of very informative videos for
Celestial_Navigation_pi. Let him step you through the process visually,
and you will learn the differences from traditional calculations as
well. His videos:

==== General Traditional Theory

A general, but very clear text on celestial positioning is available in
the PDF file on the web site of Henning Umland:

* http://www.celnav.de/page2.htm[A Short Guide to Celestial Navigation(pdf 5mb)]

Many thanks to Henning Umland for this concise text. Naturally, also the
information provided by the Nautical Almanac and Bowditch is of interest
(see 'Links').

==== Plugin Computation Methods

The plugin is still under development and the computation methods used
are innovative and based on vector, matrix and least squares methods.
The author, Sean d'Epagnier, uses this innovative method to directly
calculate a fix position. Only he knows the background and details.

General information on direct computation methods can be found on pages
277 to 285 of the Nautical Almanac 1994 (see 'Links') and in the
following articles:

* image::cel_nav_new_computational_methods_04_2014_01_2_.pdf[New
Computational Methods for Solving Problems of the Astronomical Vessel
Position (pdf 1.7mb)]
* image::cel_nav_direct_fix_v44n1-2.pdf[The
Direct Fix of Latitude and Longitude from two observed Altitudes (pdf
1mb)]
* image::cel_nav_generic_03_2012_06.pdf[Genetic
Algorithm for Solving Celestial Navigation Problems (pdf 435kb)]

Presently, the plugin is not capable of advancing COP's to a common
time. When a shift is entered, the calculated numerical position on the
main window disappears. In this case, the fix can only be established by
visual examination of the graphics on the screen (see also 3. Sight
Properties - Date and Time Tab, and 8. Four Circles of Position) and a
fix time cannot be established.

=== Accuracy of Data

* http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/celnavtable.php[Celestial Navigation Data for Assumed Position and Time- Navy]
* http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem/[Astronomical Software Ephemeris]

==== Comparison of Plugin Astronomical Data and Nautical Almanac Data

The data and formulae contained in the Nautical Almanac form a standard
in itself. The plugin utilizes astronomical data from VOP87d (for the
planets and indirectly for the sun), ELP2000/82 (for the moon) and
contains Right Ascension (RA; star's SHA = 360° - star's RA) and
Declination (Dec) data for the selected stars.

During development of the plugin, the calculated (intermediate)
correction values for dip, refraction, horizontal parallax, parallax in
altitude and semi diameter, as well as the calculated position fix,
should be compared to values that result from other computation methods.

The astronomical data used in the plugin is more accurate than data
taken from the Nautical Almanac. However, for navigation purposes the
differences are generally not important. With regard to altitude
reductions, so far test data indicates that the differences found in
calculated observed altitude (Ho) are small. Measurement and reading
errors made by the navigator will be larger. Using the present version,
calculated fix positions can still differ from those calculated with
traditional methods.

==== Accuracy of Plugin Astronomical Data

The plugin astronomical data are from Jean Meeus' Astronomical
Algorithms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Meeus[Wikapedia]
https://sourceforge.net/projects/astroalgorithms/[Sourceforge].

* Planetary positions are based upon a truncated version of
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988A%26A...202..309B[Bretagnon and Francou's VSOP87] theory
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_(planets)[Wikipedia VSOP] . The
estimated maximum error in the heliocentric longitude is several
arc-seconds. Geocentric positions are accurate to within a few
arc-seconds.
* Lunar positions are calculated using a truncated version of the
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983A%26A...124...50C[lunar theory ELP-2000/82 of Chapront-Touzé and Chapront]. The estimated maximum error in the geocentric longitude is about 10 arc-seconds.

==== Accuracy of Data in the Printed Nautical Almanac

The largest error that can occur in GHA and declination of any body
other than the Sun or Moon is less than 0.2'; it may reach 0.25' for the
Sun and 0.3' for that of the Moon. In practice it may be expected that
only one third of the values of GHA and declination will have errors
larger than 0.05', and less than one tenth will have errors larger than
0.1'.

The errors in the altitude corrections are nominally in the same order
(_but the actual values of dip and refraction at low altitudes may
differ considerably in extreme atmospheric conditions_).

Depending on the type of sextant, the reading accuracy of the sextant
can be 0.2', 0.1' or 10“. Measurement and reading errors made by the
navigator will be larger.

==== Online source of Celestial Navigation Data

This page allows you to obtain all the astronomical information
necessary to plot navigational lines of position from observations of
the altitudes of celestial bodies. Simply fill in the form below and
click on the “Get data” button at the end of the form.

A table of data will be provided giving both almanac data and altitude
corrections for each celestial body that is above the horizon at the
place and time that you specify. Sea-level observations are assumed.
Very useful for study, testing and comparisons.

While the existing plugin worked well with sun, moon, and planet sights,
it was not treating stars correctly. This update adds corrections for
star sights.

. It uses updated star positions from the
http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/[SIMBAD Astronomical Database].
. Positions are corrected for proper motion and parallax.
. Positions are corrected for frame bias, precession, and nutation.

==== Summary of Accuracy

We believe the current values should be usable for navigation -
certainly within the accuracy that can be expected for a human holding a
sextant on a vessel at sea. But clearly there are still some minor
corrections required to get the exact same values as the USNO.

=== Abbreviations

Some abbreviations of terms are given in the list hereunder. Not all of
these abbreviations conform to a standard.

*AP*- Assumed Position- where you are _or think you are_ based on
Latitude and Longitude.

*COP*- Circle of Position (Circle of Equal Altitude)

*Dec*- Declination- the angle in degrees of a celestial body above or
below the celestial equator. It's analogous to latitude on earth.

*DR*- Dead Reckoning Position (from _Deduced Reckoning)_

*HA*- Hour Angle

*GP*- Geographical Position of a heavenly body. It has two components;
declination and GHA. _Dec,_ or declination, mentioned above, is
analogous to latitude on earth. In Western longitudes a heavenly body's
GHA equals the longitude of the GP. In Eastern longitudes the GP equals
360° _minus_ GHA. If at a given point in time you were at the GP of a
celestial body it would be directly over your head- your zenith.

*GMT/UT*- Greenwich Mean Time and Universal Time. For celestial
navigation work all observations are recorded in time and date based on
Greenwich, England. GMT is also known as “UT”.

*GHA*- _Greenwich Hour Angle_- the angular distance in degrees between
Greenwich (0°) and a celestial object. GHA is always measured West of
Greenwich.

*LHA*- _Local Hour Angle_- the horizontal angular distance in degrees
between the Ap (Assumed position) and a celestial object. It is always
measured West from the Ap. to the celestial object.

*LOP*- Line of Position

*MPP*- Most Probable Position

*RA*- Right Ascension (star's SHA = 360^o^ _minus_ the star's RA)

*SHA*- Sidereal Hour Angle

*D-R-I-P-S*

* *Dip* of the Horizon (function of eye height)
* *R*- Refraction (function of Ha, temperature and pressure)
* *IE*- Index Error (= + or _minus_ Index Error of sextant)
* *PA*- Parallax in Altitude (function of HP and Ha)
* *SD*- Semi-Diameter. One half of the angular width of the Sun or Moon.

*HP*- Horizontal Parallax

*Hs*- Sextant Altitude- the initial, uncorrected, sextant measurement
from the horizon to a celestial body. Also known as _Height of sextant._

*Ha*- Apparent Altitude= Hs _minus_ Dip +or _minus_ IC (Index
Correction) Also known as _Apparent Height._

*Ho*- Observed Altitude- final corrected sextant angular measurement.
Also known as _Height observed._

*Hc*- Computed Altitude. Also known as _Height computed._

*Int*- Intercept (=Ho + or _minus_ Hc) Always subtract the smaller
figure from the larger.

*Z*- Azimuth. Horizontal angle in degrees between True North and the
celestial body.

ABSTRACT +
In this work, we employ a genetic algorithm, from the field of
artificial intelligence, due to its superior search ability that mimics
the natural process of biological evolution. Unique encodings and
genetic operators designed in this study, in combination with the fix
principle of celestial circles of equal altitude in celestial
navigation, allow the rapid and direct attainment of accurate optimum
vessel position. Test results indicate that this method has more
flexibility, and avoids tedious and complicated computation and
graphical procedures.

ABSTRACT +
In this paper, a simplified and direct computation method formulated by
the fixed coordinate system and relative meridian concept in conjunction
with vector algebra is developed to deal with the classical problems of
celestial navigation. It is found that the proposed approach, the
Simultaneous Equal-altitude Equation Method (SEEM), can directly
calculate the Astronomical Vessel Position (AVP) without an additional
graphical procedure. The SEEM is not only simpler than the matrix method
but is also more straightforward than the Spherical Triangle Method
(STM). Due to tedious computation procedures existing in the commonly
used methods for determining the AVP, a set of optimal computation
procedures for the STM is also suggested. In addition, aimed at
drawbacks of the intercept method, an improved approach with a new
computation procedure is also presented to plot the celestial line of
position without the intercept. The improved approach with iteration
scheme is used to solve the AVP and validate the SEEM successfully.
Methods of solving AVP problems are also discussed in detail. Finally, a
benchmark example is included to demonstrate these proposed methods.

ABSTRACT +
This work presents a direct method for obtaining the latitude and
longitude of an observer from the observed altitudes of two celestial
bodies. No assumed position or dead-reckoned position or plotting is
required. Starting with the Greenwich hour angles, declinations, and
observed altitudes of each pair, the latitude and longitude of the two
points from which the observations must have been made are directly
computed. The algorithm is presented in the paper, along with its
derivation. Two different, inexpensive, programmable pocket electronic
calculators were programmed to execute the algorithm, and they do it in
under 30 s. The algorithm was also programmed to run on a personal
computer to examine the effect of the precision of the calculations on
the error in the results. The findings show that the use of eight
decimal places in the trigonometric computations provides acceptable
results.

ABSTRACT +
Although many mathematical approaches to the celestial fix problem have
been published, all of them fundamentally assume a stationary observer.
Since this situation seldom occurs in practice, methods have been
developed that effectively remove the observer's motion from the problem
before a fix is determined. As an alternative, this paper presents a
development of celestial navigation that incorporates a moving observer
as part of its basic construction. This development allows recovery of
the information on the vessel's course and speed contained in the
observations. Thus, it provides the means for determining, from a
suitable ensemble of celestial observations, the values of all four
parameters describing a vessel's rhumb-line track across the earth:
latitude and longitude at a specified time, course, and speed. In many
cases, this technique will result in better fixes than traditional
methods.

Abstract +
“By the standards of modern astrometry, the earth is quite a wobbly
platform from which to observe the sky. The earth's rotation rate is not
uniform, its axis of rotation is not fixed in space, and even its shape
and relative positions of its surface locations are not fixed. For the
purposes of pointing a telescope to one-arcsecond accuracy, we need not
worry about shape and surface feature changes, but changes in the
orientation of the earth's rotation axis are very important. ”

This is an update of work done originally in 2012. We have used it in

https://my.vanderbilt.edu/astronav/review/[Supplemental Page]

This free and open to the public, online course is made possible by The
Blended & Online Learning Design (BOLD) Fellows Program and is hosted by
Vanderbilt University. The BOLD Fellows program allows graduate
student-faculty teams to create course materials in STEM subject areas
rooted in good course design principles which benefit from the online
content delivery.

This course serves to address the lack of widely-available instruction
in astronavigation. Specifically targeted here are the steps of
performing a sight reduction to obtain a terrestrial position using this
technique. These steps are explicitly illustrated after a brief overview
provides a solid context for their relevance. Difficult concepts such as
plotting on a navigational chart and the complexities of using of
navigational publications should be better served through this online
content delivery.

==== Kubek's Sights to test Accuracy of the Plugin

image::my_astro_sight_2017.txt.doc[My Astro Sight 2017]

image::track_with_astro.zip[Track with Sighting Waypoints]

Please remove ”.doc“ and “my_astro_” from “my_astro_sights.xml” and place in your programdata/opencpn/plugins/celestial_navigation/ directory. Also please remove ”.doc“ from “my_astro_sight_2017.txt.doc”.

===== Kubek's Notes

'Mer Pass' is Meridian passages of the Sun (LL) or The Noon Sight (RYA Astronavigation Chapter 5).

All my sights are NOT in the same time so you need to do “running fix”(maybe somebody can improve this plugin to have build in drawing “running fix”). For all 17 sights, I first calculated on paper during passage using Sight Reduction Tables + Almanac for 2017 and to compere it, I do it again using Long Term Almanac 2000-2050 - Kolbe (which isgreat). Lastly I put my sight into plugin to check it and it looks OK. Same as my paper work (except Mer Pass).

What I would like to see as an option to this plugin is “Meridian passage of the Sun”. I used those sight as Sun LL in the plugin but it is NOT as precise as could be (Astro17 - I have on the paper 18°10'N [on GPS it was 18°10,6'N] - plugin draw circle in 18°12.9'N - the reason is that time of the 'Mer Pass' of the Sun is very difficult to measure precisely).

==== Testing: Armchair testing of Celestial Navigation

===== A Simplified Example

NOTE: The menu selection *Sight Highlighted > Edit > Sight > FIND* is used to help find the Altitude, Azimuth or the celestial bodies, and currently does not calculate any of the Parameter corrections. Indeed, these calculations would have to be the mathmatical reverse of those found in the file sightdialog.cpp (Lines 151-159) and would have to be done in reverse order. The reason this is important, is if you use this armchair method, the circles of position will not be exact, so your fix will not be as accurate as if you actually take a sight.

We are going to use the all the same times and locations for the sights. Everything that can be set the same will be.

*Simplification: Parameters that are always the same:*

* Clock Offset =0
* Time: Boston Time ( UTC-5): Oct 10, 2017, 13:00 so UTC 10/10/17 18:00
* DR Shift: Distance=0 Bearing=0
* Parameters: Eye height=2.0 m Temp 10 c, Pressure=1010, Index Error 0
min
* Latitude: 42.35, Longitude to -71.1

*What is different:*

* Using “Find” and Altitude set for the Star and enter the Lat/Long above:
* Star - Altitude Entered
* Alkaid 79.501993
* Kochab 58.133196
* Arcturus 66.507224
* Sun 36.888867

I suppose I should go up to the rooftop to use my sextant and learn how to take sights again. But that is not the purpose here. We want to check Celestial_Navigation_pi. So this an armchair method that I think may be ok using the “Find” Button. (Short Answer: I think the problem was the default setting of “Clock Offset: -10000 seconds”! This should be set at default=0 IMHO)

Here is a sample test

image::sights.xml.doc[sight.xml.doc]

file that you can use if you would like. Remove the ”.doc“ please. You can rename your own sights.xml file for reuse later, and load this one….for Windows Users this file is in _C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\celestial_navigation_.

===== Process

{empty}1. In OpenCPN with Celestial_Navigation_pi “Enabled”, first 
*Locate the Boat*! +
2. The *Own Boat* location is used for the Sight > “Find” function.
“*Find*” will be used to get '_altitude_' or '_azimuth_' for a given
_celestial body_, at _the boat's location or a location you entered_ at
a _UTC time_. +
3. Right Click, Drop a waypoint and then Right click on WP, pick
Properties set lat 42.35 long -71.10 Boston,Ma +
4. Try to Right-click “*Move the boat*” to the exact location of the
waypoint. (I would really appreciate a Right-click “Move to lat\long”
feature. +
5. *Clock Offset* Button. Check that Clock Offset = “0” 6. In Cel_Nav
Pick “*New*“ +

{empty}29. Later added more sights and selected the 4 best ones and hit
*Fix* and got about .6nm away.

NOTE: The altitude & azimuth given with the “FIND” button is without the
Parameter's Tab corrections, so it will not be as accurate as an actual
Sight.
