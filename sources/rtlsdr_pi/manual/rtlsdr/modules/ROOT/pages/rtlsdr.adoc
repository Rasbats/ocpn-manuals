== Rtlsdr USB

For AIS vhf and more on tv tuner usb dongle

Use a low cost USB DVB-T (Digital TV) receiver for AIS messages from
Ships. Various dongles are supported, the r820-t works the best and is
also the cheapest (typically $8 US)

==== Notes for Mac RTLSDR

https://github.com/nohal/OpenCPN/wiki/RTL-SDR-AIS-on-macOS

==== Hardware Setup:

You must use a proper vhf antenna, not the one included with the dongle.
I cut the antenna coax included with the dongle, and spliced it to the
vhf coax. You must solder both inner and outer (shield) connections.

==== Software Setup:

==== Linux

You must now compile rtl-sdr from source:

[source,code]
----
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
----

Next, you must have either aisdecoder or gnuradio (with gr-ais).

For aisdecoder:

[source,code]
----
wget
http://www.aishub.net/downloads/
aisdecoder
.
tar
.
gz tar zxvf aisdecoder.tar.gz
cd aisdecoder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
----

For gnuradio with gr-ais: <not completed>

==== Windows

You must run the program zadig to install the driver available here
http://zadig.akeo.ie/ The default settings should be fine.

The receiver program (rtl_fm) and decoder (aisdecoder) are included as
pre-built binaries, so from here, install the plugin setup package. So
far I have no pre-built packages for gnuradio on windows, but this would
be useful if provided. If there are issues it may be helpful to install
the sdrsharp program to determine if the dongle is receiving data at
all.

==== All Platforms

It should be possible (from the preferences dialog) to calibrate the
dongle with the Auto Calibrate button:

From what I can tell so far, the error correction range is +- 128 (my
two dongles use values of 35 and 50) and must be within 5 for aisdecoder
and 15-20 for gnuradio. When the value is more accurate, more ais
messages are received as well.

From here, install the plugin package, or build from source and install.
This works best in an area with a lot of ais traffic. Once calibrated,
ships should appear on the chart.
