logs for your boat.

The plugin is now maintained by Del, Konnibe has been unable to continue
development due to ill health.

==== 6. Editing the LogBook

An illustration worth a thousand words, follow these screenshots.

*1. The elevator* that allows you to choose the model that you want to
modify / improve :

 +
*2. The window that allows you to launch the editor* (LibreOffice or
other), after clicking on *E* (editor), just click OK and if the path is
correct (put the path in the logbook settings), LibreOffice or other
opens automatically :

 +
*3. The model that can be modified at will* (the labels start with *L*,
as a label) and then save. +
Note the hooks and braces that must not be removed. +
Also note that by clicking on “View” in the Logbook, it is possible to
continue to appreciate the changes made, after having saved the changes.

The manipulation is exactly the same for an *edition in HTML* (which can
be saved in PDF) but a little more complex because it requires the use
of a free soft specific KompoZer.exe. +
Note that the path to Kompozer must also be indicated in the LogBook
Settings/preferences (last line). +
Note also that for LibreOffice, Swriter.exe should be specified and not
writer.exe…

On youtube, you will find a brief tutorial that explains the first steps
with KompoZer.exe (and the link to download this soft) :

HTML …_*
