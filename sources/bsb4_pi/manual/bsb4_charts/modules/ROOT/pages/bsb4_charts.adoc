=== Goal

Provides Windows support only, for BSB Version 4 Raster charts, a format
currently (December 2019) used only by Maptech. The coverage is limited
to US only. The BSB4 plug-in enables OpenCPN to open and read the
encrypted charts correctly provided that the charts have been purchased,
registered and the plugin is installed properly. Supported charts must
have been installed with appropriate encryption certificates in place.
This plug-in only works with Windows.

There are several sources of charts:

* Charts published by Maptech for the US.
http://www.richardsonscharts.com/companion-software-list[Maptech/
Richardsons Charts].
* Legacy charts published by Maptech with a wide geographical coverage.
* Legacy charts published by
thehttp://www.charts.gc.ca/index-eng.asp[Canadian Hydrographics Service]
http://www.charts.gc.ca/index-eng.asp[(CHS)]
* Legacy charts produced by the
http://www.hydro.gov.au/prodserv/digital/ausRNC/rnc.htm[Australian
Hydrographic Service].

The chart installation procedure is independent of OpenCPN. At the time
this plugin was first published the creator of the plugin posted on
http://www.cruisersforum[www.cruisersforum] as follows:

* This plugin supports Windows only.
* The BSB4 charts will be available only on the computer where they were
successfully first installed and registered by the original end user.
* The plug-in makes no attempt to understand or “crack” the encryption
algorithms. The DLL interface is treated as an opaque portal to read the
decrypted files. The plug-in acts as a “wrapper” to make the charts
visible.
* The BSB4 PlugIn won't be distributed as open source.

It will be a binary-only DLL, looking just like all other PlugIns at
run-time.

* Please take careful notes of the 2nd point above. If a user somehow
“acquires” a copy of an encrypted BSB4 chart folio, it won't be useable
with this plugin.

*In summary, the plug-in will only work for registered charts on the
computer where they were first installed and registered. The plug-in is
NOT a means to obtain free charts.*

The downloaded file is an installer which will place a DLL in the
“plugins” folder of the OpenCPN installation. The installer will attempt
to place it in the correct location but if your directory structure is
“non-standard” the plug-in may not end up in the correct location. On a
standard installation the plug-in folder will be C:\Program Files
(x86)\OpenCPN\plugins\ If you have a non-standard installation then it
will be up to you to ensure that the BSB4 plug-in (bsb4_pi.dll) appears
in the correct folder - just copy it into the right location if it
doesn't get there by itself.

Once the plug-in DLL is in the correct plug-ins folder it will appear in
the options/plugins menu when you start OpenCPN. You will need to
navigate to Options (the wrench menu item), select the plug-ins tab,
find the BSB4 plug-in and click “enable” in order to use the plug-in.

With the plug-in successfully installed in the OpenCPN plug-ins
directory and enabled there is one further step necessary to view your
encrypted charts.

From the Options menu, select the Charts tab.

Then add the appropriate directory(ies) where your encryption
certificates are located, followed by the directory(ies) where the
encrypted charts are located.

The screenshot above is from a successful installation. Your directory
structure will no doubt be completely different but the same principles
apply.

In the example above, the non-encrypted charts are located on Dropbox.

Then there are two separate encryption directories followed by the
directory which contains the encrypted charts.

To recap the process, the following are the steps necessary to install
and use the BSB4 plug-in:

. Purchase and install encrypted BSB4 charts on the same computer that
will run OpenCPN with the BSB4 plug-in
. Download and run the BSB4 plug-in installer
. Ensure that the plug-in DLL has in fact been created in the
appropriate plug-in folder. If not, copy the DLL to the required
location.
. Start the OpenCPN software and enable the BSB4 plug-in
. Add the appropriate encryption and chart directories to the OpenCPN
chart locator.

Typically if you follow all the steps the charts will immediately be
visible at this point. On occasion however they will not immediately
appear and you may need to exit the OpenCPN software, closing it
completely and then reopening it. At that point the encrypted charts
should be visible.
